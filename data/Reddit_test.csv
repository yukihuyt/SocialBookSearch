* Fantasy. Fantasy fantasy fantasy. I love it, it’s my favorite genre. Both contemporary and original. Magic is a plus. *Required.*
* Revolutions or uprisings. Any of those are always appreciated.
* A diverse cast.
* Races and politics and religion. I like developed worlds.
* LGBT characters and protagonists. Those are awesome, since I’ve yet to read a fantasy novel with an LGBT protagonist.
* Powerful vocabulary and a mature prose style that avoids redundancy and cliche. No purple prose. Ever.
* Tragedy is sometimes cool. Watching characters suffer and characters supporting the characters that suffer make my heart sink.
* Developed romance. Ordinarily, I avoid romantically-focused novels, but if you have a recommendation that has a romantic side-plot that isn’t shallow or boring, that I can actually get behind, then please, show me.

I really enjoyed Harry Potter, Witch & Wizard, and Alice in Wonderland, and I hated Maximum Ride (didn't like the writing style) and never cared for the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini.

I own a copy of the book and I very much want to read it- I love dystopian stories- but am concerned about the content. 

My roommate and I were discussing whether or not the wisdom gained from reading is worth the depression it may cause. She was of the opinion that in some cases, it's not worth it. Also, she knows what kinds of things bother me to the point of obsession and this book contains some of those themes.

Thoughts? Is it a read that will depress the hell outta me, and if so, is it worth it anyway?

2nwgi5,"Confession of a Re-Reader: I really like reading. Like a lot of you, I imagine, I love to curl up by the fire with a good book. Or in the bath. Or on the bus. Or, sometimes, even while walking. Anywhere, really. And I like no place better than a second-hand bookshop; one where I can lose track of time as I see what treasures I can find.

And yet, I have a confession.

I think I might prefer re-reading some books to reading new ones. Reading a new book means getting to know a whole new bunch of characters, each with their own stories and motivations and goals. Some books I've already read, though, can feel comfortable. Like an old jacket or a comfy chair. You know what's going on, why it's happening and even *how it'll end*, but that allows you to appreciate the beauty of it happening, savouring each moment as it's described without worrying how the story will end.

Reading a new book is a networking event where everyone is in suits and ties (or commensurate for ladies), champagne is being passed around and everyone is getting to know each other; it's exciting, new, uncertain, potentially the beginning of a whole new phase of one's life or way of seeing the world, but potentially too a catastrophe never to be spoken of again. Reading an old book, though, is like seeing those friends you keep in touch with from your university days; you go round to see them and a decade, or two, or three, or more, drop away and you are instantly comfortable around each other, picking up the threads of old conversations.

And some days, that's what I need. I can't cope with new characters doing new things, getting put through emotionally tortuous experiences or exploring new places. I can't handle anything new; I want the old, the comfortable and the familiar. It's giving in, perhaps, it's limiting myself, even wasting time that could be spent reading something new, but the familiar is so tempting.

I want to follow the Fellowship through Moria again, or wander the streets of Ankh-Morpork with the City Watch, or listen to Lennie talk about the rabbits, or even eavesdrop on Hamlet contemplating suicide.

Is anyone else a re-reader? What are your favourite books to re-read, for that comfortable feeling? Do you re-read especially at a particular time or place? Or when you're busy? Or do you have a familiar book on the go all the time, alongside newer ones?

Edit: Thank you very much for the gold! This is easily the most up-voted thing I've ever posted to reddit, and one of the most interesting threads I've participated in.

It's fascinating to see everyone's answers; from the people who never re-read books (...strange folk that they are!) because they need the adrenaline-rush of a new book with new characters and new places, to those who are open to the idea of re-reading but can't bring themselves to do it in a world where there are so many books yet to be read for the first time, to those who relive parts of their lives with every book they re-read, to those like me. 

You've all reminded me, too, of books I had half-forgotten that really deserve another read, and of those series that I had heard good things about but had never got around to reading; so many of you find something in *The Dark Tower* series, for instance, and I've yet to read it. Bizarrely, this thread might well end up pushing me to read a number of books for the first time.

But I'd rather think of it as setting me to be able to re-read them, one day.",0

What top stories, info, insights, histories are English speakers missing out on? Is these a Japanese equivalent to a story as beautiful as East of Eden? Is there a Spanish equivalent to character development as engaging as the Malcom X autobiography? Is there a Hindi equivalent to something as insightful as How to Win Friends and Influence People.  

Some books I can't imagine living my life without, and it's kinda scary to think about if How to Win Friends and Influence People was written in another language, and not having a chance to come across its life changing insights.   

But, there are probably life changing insights that I am missing out on since English is spoken by about 6% of the world. That means all the books we see on these top book lists represent only 6% of the world of literature out there! Can you imagine the insights/stories we're missing out on??

2nx7ub,"How does the Kindle Voyage compare to the older kindle models?: I hate touch screens with a burning passion. I owned a second generation kindle, and it was great to use for the past few years. Unfortunately it was stolen, but that is a hazard of living in NYC and using technology in public. Now I have to buy something new.

I am considering getting the newest kindle because it's the only one with buttons. I was wondering if owners of the device could shed some light on this: how do the page turn buttons compare to the big, clicky page turn buttons on the old kindle? What do they feel like to press down?

The description of ""pagepress"" claims that you can ""turn the page without lifting a finger"". I think it is amazing that they could precisely describe the opposite of what I want in an e-reader. When I use an e-reader, I tend to want to handle it the way I would a book, not my cellphone. For the old kindle, I could just hold the thing without having to worry about pressing a button accidentally. I'm wondering if the new kindle can deliver this?

I'm also wondering if it's possible to turn the touchscreen off. Again, there is nothing that irks me more than turning a page accidentally. I also tend to read with my finger on the page, which is difficult if the device is constantly thinking that I'm turning the page.

2nxlib,"Last Chance To See set my brain on fire: I just finished Last Chance to See. I had read almost everything else by Douglas Adams, the Hitchhiker's Guide as well as the Dirk Gently series and the Salmon of Doubt. He's probably my all time favourite author, managing to tickle my funny bone and almost bring me to tears with emotion at the same time. Every time I smiled or laughed and looked like an idiot on public transports, I was also deeply saddened to know there was a limited supply of such fantastic wit and I almost reached the end of the barrel. 

Yet, it's all good for me because the bottom of the barrel is also very tasty. Extremely tasty even. When you get lines like these

*I didn't notice that I was being set upon by a pickpocket, which I am glad of, because I like to work only with professionals.*

in the middle of powerful reflections on animal conservations such as these

*The state it's in now is only the result of what we've done to it, and the mildness of the disappointment we feel when we arrive somewhere and find that it's a bit tatty is only a measure of how far our own expectations have been degraded and how little we understand what we've lost. The people who do understand what we've lost are the ones who are rushing around in a frenzy trying to save the bits that are left.*

I think my brain just melted a little.

Douglas Adams has said that Last Chance To See is probably his favourite book and the one which sold the least (and probably was read the least I suspect). In this [wonderful Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZG8HBuDjgc) you'll get a glimpse of the book and you'll learn all about the Kakapo, which is a bird that's hard not to fall in love with (and the reason why I finally picked up the book in the first place). 

So if you haven't read this book but you've enjoyed Douglas Adams in the past, or if you want to learn more about endangered species, I urge you to pick up this book which made me really happy.

And if you have read it, I'd be curious to know when you encountered it and what you thought of it. Much like the Hitchhiker's Guide over time, I felt it started as a jolly and witty book and gradually became darker and more serious.",0

For some reason I'd avoided anthologies, but now that I've looked into some of them I'm kicking myself for not trying them sooner. If you want to learn about the past of great books in one quick set, for example, you could do a lot worse than [The Norton Anthology of World Literature]. And this isn't limited to classics, of course. There are great anthologies for modern stories that I'm slowly discovering too.

Do you like anthologies? What are your favorites? I'd be particularly interested to learn about some great genre anthologies, i.e. for fantasy, horror, mystery, etc. A good postmodern anthology would be badass, too.",1

Came across it in a local thrift shop. It's a very nice edition of a great novel, so I couldn't just leave it there. 

I'm curious though, does it have any value beyond my personal interest?",0
2ny3ft,"Quality of Popular Fantasy - David Mitchell vs. Patrick Rothfuss: I just finished David Mitchell's *The Bone Clocks*, and found it to be one of the best books I've ever read. Then, wrongly assuming that popular consensus, as it did in the case of mitchell, would correlate with quality, I started *The Name of the Wind*, the first in Patrick Rothfuss's series about someone named Kvothe. I couldn't get more than twelve pages in because the writing quality was so bad. Consider this line from the first page: ""The man had true-red hair, red as flame.""

I'd recently become frustrated with [James Wood](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/soul-cycle)'s seeming prejudice against fantasy, but if this is what is considered ""good"" in fantasy circles, I can understand why. However, this brings me to a question, and I am serious in asking it.

How did Patrick Rothfuss become so popular while being so stylistically bad? Did he have Eragon-level connections? He surfaced again and again when I was looking for new fantasy, and tends to get good reviews, but his craft would barely win him a B+ in a sophomore-level creative writing seminar.

Is it possible that he writes purposefully badly, so that readers can imagine themselves as able to be similarly successful?

Am I just spoiled by David Mitchell? (Note that I'm reading Sam Harris' *Free Will* right now and have no problem with his craft.)

Keep in mind that I don't begrudge anyone for enjoying a book which almost certainly has an engaging and intriguing plot, and that I've also not been able to get through any of George R. R. Martin's stuff. So is fantasy writing's usual caliber generally lower, or just different, or have I missed something huge?",0

2nyah1,What are your reading habits?: Do you guys schedule the time? Pick a book up when it's in your reach? Do you read different books at the same time? Do you have to-read lists? In my personal experience I don't really organize myself in what to read at any given time. At times I am reading up to 7 books at the same time and I rarely finish all of them when another title gets my attention. In essence I want to know how do you organize yourselves to finish all the books you want to read. Thanks in advance for your responses.,0
