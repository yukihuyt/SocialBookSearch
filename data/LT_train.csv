100139,"In the Arianna Huffington nonfiction work I just read, she mentions Benjamin Disraeli and his novel, Sybil (1845), meant to be a wake-up call about the horrible state of the British working class. According to this report the book ""became a sensation and the outrage it provoked propelled fundamental social reforms"".  Of course Dickens had also written Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby in the late 1830s.  In 1852, American teacher and abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin which is credited for greatly advancing the abolitionist cause. The book was THE bestselling novel in America in the 19th century (and the second top book of any kind, behind only the bible). A few more examples: In 1861 Life in the Iron Mills, a novella by Rebecca Harding Davis was published anonymously in the Atlantic Monthly. It highlights in a rare realism the lives of exploited foundry workers in what is now West Virginia. In 1906 Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle, a novel which sought to expose the corruption in the meat-packing industry (he intended to expose the exploitation of the factory worker but the public latched on to a food safety issue).  Here is a bit more from the Huffington book which is about the declining middle class in the US: ""But no matter how sobering the statistics we are getting on a regular basis...the hardships and suffering ten of millions of Americans are experiencing are almost entirely absent from our popular culture. This is a shame, because drama and narrative have the ability to move people's perceptions in a way that raw numbers never can.  Do you believe this statement is still true? If yes, do you believe this is true on a societal (or mass) level or only on an individual level? If yes, what is some contemporary novels whose narrative had the ability to change your perceptions? If no, what in our culture do you feel is now serving that purpose?  (there's more questions I could add, but I thought this would be a good starter. I don't want to discuss Huffington here, but just the idea she has brought up).",no
100184,"For years I have been looking for a paperback book my friend had from the late '70s or early '80s. It had a two-word title, something like Ghostly Terrors or Horrors, and the cover featured a dark illustration of a horse-drawn carriage. Something about the way the stories were written cut to the bone - it was one of the most terrifying collections I have ever read. It was apparently aimed at young adults, but I wouldn't have given it to anyone under 18! Some of the stories were - A woman traveling at night stops at a hotel and sees a woman in her room. She looks in the closet and discovers a skeleton. A man traveling by foot at night runs into a man who is revealed to have no face. He flees and meets another man who, ultimately, is shown to have no face as well. A man meets up with a friend he thought was dead. The first man becomes drunk and the second puts him on his horse which races off into the night. The man wakes up to find himself on a monument in a cemetery. Something about a man who is cruel to animals being lead to his death by giant black cats A manor house haunted by a woman and her child",yes

100656," The Contemplator Ivan Kramskoy BK Book 3 ch. 6 Dear Salonistas The time is upon us! With only 15 days to go before the November 1 start of our final tome read for 2010, I'd like to get an idea of who will be joining us, and to put a few ideas out there for feedback. In consultation with the Benevolent Wisdom of our Great Leader (Long may he Live!), I plan the following threads, a cat's cradle of Russian Madness, a tapestry of Dostoevskyan tears and laughter, a weft and warp of vodka and herring. I hereby propose: 1. A series of chronological discussion threads going through book by book, for example:  KARAMAZOV Book 1. Rather than having thematic threads as we had with IJ, I think a chronological approach will make it easier for people to read at their own pace and yet not get their reading messed up with plot spoilers. I'll use these threads to put up salient points chapter by chapter, notes, thematic discussions, anything I can think of that will help readers to come to grips with the book, explanations of historical background, questions from readers etc. 2. A KARAMAZOV Quote thread, for salonistas to put up their favourite quotes, and to spark discussion on those quotes, a kind of closer reading, I-love/hate-this-bit- thread.  3. A Dostoevsky Quote thread. I have hundreds of Dostoevsky quotes from my last two years of reading. I""ll just bang these up in random order for people to enjoy, comment on, tie into their reading of BK, or other books, or life (what is life, btw?) We already have a prep thread for this read, with discussion on translations etc  here So, what say ye all thereto?  If you're joining the read, could you put your hand/fin/flapper/paw/other body part up so I can get an idea of who's in. Muchas Gracias. Murr  Of course, no one is bound by anything; he can also drop the book after two pages of the story and never pick it up again. But still there are readers of such delicacy that they will certainly want to read to the very end so as to make no mistake in their impartial judgement.  BK From the Author ",no

A fascinating programme with some great archive audio featuring Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud and Richard Burton, more recent interviews with Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh, as well as excerpts from classic radio and film performances by Olivier and Gielgud. ______________________________________________ Archive on 4: Playing the Dane http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vg909 In anticipation of his own stage Hamlet in 2011, Michael Sheen looks back at classic productions of the play and the many different interpretations of a young actor's most coveted role. The last few years have seen a glut of high-profile Hamlets in the British theatre, culminating recently with Rory Kinnear at the National Theatre in London and John Simm at Sheffield Crucible. Michael Sheen, who is due to play the role at the Young Vic in 2011, asks why Shakespeare's play remains very much the thing for 21st century audiences. He considers the rich archive of Hamlets from the theatre, cinema and radio archives, starting with Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree in 1908 and journeying to the present-day, taking in the interpretations of John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier, Richard Burton, Jonathan Pryce, Kenneth Branagh and David Tennant, as well as female Hamlets, Sarah Bernhardt and Frances de la Tour. Michael explores the challenges of a role that has become a rite-of-passage for leading actors, arguing that Hamlet is the most dangerous play that exists, but that our culture has made it safe. He examines the changing political, social and psychological interpretations of the role that holds a mirror up to history, from the Edwardian stage through Freud, Modernism and two World Wars, to Thatcherism and New Labour. Michael is joined by other famous Hamlets, who reflect on the challenges of bringing something fresh and unexpected to some of the most famous lines in English literature. Produced by Emma Harding. ______________________________________________ Another fascinating Hamlet resource from the BBC is: http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/hamlet/8508.shtml",no

102686,"Sorry to post another review so quickly. I was actually in the middle of The Best of Weird Tales when I read The Gunslinger. Anyway this is a first run through and I think it's okay, but I can see it's missing something. --- One of the several Weird Tales anthologies available is titled Weird Tales: The Magazine That Never Dies. That title is appropriate as the magazine habitually goes in and out of print. The title of this one, The Best of Weird Tales isnt quite as accurate. It is actually the best of the Weird Tales revival that ran from 1988-1994. If you are looking for the original Weird Tales heavyweights: Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, Seabury Quinn or H. P. Lovecraft, they aren't here (despite the beautiful image of Cthulhu on the cover). The book does contain plenty of big names though. F. Paul Wilson, Brian Lumley, Tad Williams, Tanith Lee, Robert Bloch, William F. Nolan, John Brunner, Ramsey Campbell, T.E.D. Klein, Harry Turtledove, Thomas Ligotti, Gene Wolfe and Karl Edward Wagner. Whew! Theres others. Those are just the names I immediately recognized. Like any anthology, the stories are of varying quality, but none of them was a total waste of time. F. Paul Wilsons Midnight Mass would probably be the best story in the book, but since the story is reproduced almost word for word in Wilsons Midnight Mass novel, I was already familiar with it. Weird Tales always contained a mix of horror, fantasy and science fiction (plus stories that defy classification) and that is certainly true of this collection. What surprised me is that a couple of the best stories were fantasy (After the Last Elf is Dead and Magician in the Dark), a genre I usually do not enjoy. On the spooky side, I loved Fruiting Bodies, Night Bloomer, The Other Dead Man and At First Just Ghostly. While none of the stories was quite an instant classic, all were at least good.",no

1030,"I'm interested in recommendations for good legal/courtroom mystery series.  Two I like are John Lescroart's Dismas Hardy series that starts with Dead Irish, and Barbara Parker's Gail Connor series that starts with Suspicion of Innocence.  There are at least a dozen books in the Dismas Hardy series, which is set in San Francisco. I like them because they are meaty stories (usually around 500 pages) with lots of recurring characters. There are even a couple where Dismas Hardy steps aside and other characters take the protagonist role.  The Gail Connor series appeals to me because, although she is a lawyer, the books are not courtroom mysteries. She is more of an amateur detective who happens to be a lawyer, than a lawyer who solves mysteries. Also, her relationship with her hot Cuban boyfriend, Anthony Quintanna, makes for an interesting side story throughout the series.  But I need a new series, since I am almost completely through with these two. Any suggestions? ",yes

103073,"A few recent threads (http://www.librarything.com/topic/102886 http://www.librarything.com/topic/95059 http://www.librarything.com/topic/102754) have made me wonder if there couldn't be some ""tripwires"" for CK that could help detect bad data being entered. Even if it didn't prevent that data from being entered, it'd be nice for it to log it to a helpers' log. An example might be a Series field that ONLY contains numeric data, or even one that doesn't contain anything in parens (that last bit might have to be scaled back if there are a LOT of legit unordered series being entered). I'm mainly thinking of tripwires for Series, but I bet similar tripwires could apply to other CK fields. A log for this would help in two ways. First, it would help the helpers go back and clean up bad data. Second, it would make it easier to catch someone who is changing a lot of CK data (like in some of the above threads) at an earlier date and send them a profile message to help them understand they aren't using CK correctly. This would probably make the total amount of cleanup a lot smaller. ETA: This wouldn't be something that prevents a user from entering bad data or something that requires an ""are you sure?"" step from the user. It's solely aimed at making a helpers' log for suspicious edits.",no

A thought experiment: In the real world the history CD and computer technology worked such that when CDs came out their DRM-less digital nature didn't immediately lead to copying. CDs were ubiquitous (and profitable) years before Napster and CD-ROM came on the scene and cut the market in half or more. But what if things had been different? What if computers with CD-ROM drives, MP3 converters and connections to a robust internet were ubiquitous before CDs came out, such that on day one of CDs everything sold on a CD was instantly, globally available as a pirated product? My guess is that labels would have pulled back on CDs. So, will piracy pick up speed quickly or slowly?

I'll set a goal of five of these, but am not sure I'll make it. I honestly must say I'm ever the skeptic because I tend to avoid books by women rather than read them.  Go ahead, though. Recommend some good ones to me and make me change my mind. I'll try to get an Orange book in my list at least for January and July. Jill has been excellent in tempting me to do this is the past.

Like most Canadians east of Winnipeg, I am a drooling semiliterate where it comes to French (although one of the joys of French for English speakers is how much easier it is to read than speak), but I would venture to wonder whether we're talking about poetry read silently or spoken aloud. Because French has a number of phonological features that I could imagine would make it conducive to recitation--the resonance of the nasalized vowels; the final-syllable stress, which I think is invariable and which strikes me as a much more powerful prosody to which to set verse than the iambic da-DA-da-DA rhythms of English.

Is it their phonetic qualities? Their prosodic shape? The way they look on the page and the sound-aesthetics and meaning-associations those words bring up for an English speaker (by sound-aesthetics, I'm thinking of the way most English-speakers might judge the made-up word amarathea to be prettier than the made-up word skogbort, and by ""meaning-associations"" I'm thinking of the way we see e.g. ""blanche"" and it conjures up a whole world of associations with the white skin of a thirteenth-century princess and the Deep South and blanched almonds, which is something unavailable to most of us if we're trying to read a poem in e.g. Turkish; or even the way the word ""hiver"" for me, even though they're pronounced differently, conjures up a sleepy hive of bees hibernating through the winter, to wake up again when the air brings the promise of spring. Whereas ""winter"", since I grew up with German, ties in strongly with German ""Winter"", and the Teutonic North and Norse gods, and is an entirely colder and more fearsome prospect, to me, than cozy ""hiver"".

105411,"In Death on the Installment Plan, Celine launches into a tirade against Symbolist art. The character, Ferdinand, works as an assistant to a carver of ""Symbolist horrors."" Celine's attack on Symbolism is ferocious and visceral. Another work, Degeneration by Max Nordau is a sustained critique against Symbolism and other concurrent art movements. ""It is the impotent despair of a sick man, who feels himself dying by inches in the midst of an eternally living nature blooming insolently for ever. It is the envy of a rich, hoary voluptuary, who sees a pair of lovers making for a sequestered forest nook; it is the mortification of the exhausted and impotent refugee from a Florentine plague seeking in an enchanted garden the experiences of a Decameron, but striving in vain to snatch one more pleasure of sense from the uncertain hour."" ""Hysteria and degeneration have always existed; but they formerly showed themselves sporadically, and had no importance in the life of the whole community. It was only the vast fatigue which was experienced by the generation on which the multitudes of discoveries and innovations burst abruptly, imposing on it organic exigencies greatly surpassing its strength, which created favourable conditions under which these maladies could gain ground enormously, and become a danger to civilization."" --Degeneration, 1892.

105584,"""Many texts were written in a late stage of the ancient Egyptian language in a highly cursive script known as Demotic. In use from ca. 650 B.C. until the middle of the fifth century A.D., Demotic served as the medium for a wide variety of text types. These include documentary texts, such as business and legal documents, private letters and administrative inscriptions, and literary texts, including not only works of literature per se, for example, narrative texts and pieces of wisdom literature, but also religious and magical texts and scientific texts dealing with topics such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. Demotic texts thus not only provide important witnesses for the development of ancient Egyptian linguistic and paleographical traditions but also constitute an indispensable source for reconstructing the social, political, and cultural life of ancient Egypt during a fascinating period of its history.""

105628,"The time has come, at last, to start our discussion of Cakes and Ale. As I remember, Urania1 suggested we set up separate threads for each chapter which I think is a great idea because I am a slow reader and have a tendency to be behind (always!) Also I will be leaving town tomorrow for a week without internet access, so I thought I'd get the ball rolling and catch up when I return.    Cammykitty has posted her thoughts on Chapters 1--3 on a different thread and Waldstein has a bang-up review of his thoughts elsewhere as well. Hope everyone reads these thoughts and responds as the opportunity arises. This is my third time through Cakes and Ale and due to my participation in the Maugham discussion group, I see this novel in a somewhat different way. Specifically, this novel is a satire and by definition, ""a literary work in which vices, follies, stupidities, abuses, etc. are held up to ridicule and contempt"" and ""the use of ridicule, sarcasm, irony, etc., to expose, attack or deride vices, follies, etc."" And from the get-go that is what Maugham does. The narrator begins by describing a popular novelist of the time and place (London, 1920's/30's) with a brief and through chronicle of the said novelist's rise to fame. The novelist, Kear, is prolific (30 novels published), sociable (a popular lecturer) and attractive (six feet tall, athletic, confident, agreeable, honest, clean, healthy, etc.) Unfortunately his talent is rather lacking and is far from ""genius"". The narrator states, ""I could think of no one among my contemporaries who had achieved so considerable a position on so litle talent. This, like the wise man's daily dose of Bemax (laxative?) might have gone into a heaped-up tablespoon. Ouch! (But, hey, this is satire!)  Kear's major talent happens to be indefatigable hard work. ""No one who for years had observed his indefatigalve industry could deny that at all events he deserved to be a genius"".  A description of Kear's work reveals  hum-drum subjects and characters but written in the best, possible good tasts. And this sells. Kear's most irritating trait is that he befriends reviewers of note in order to get his own novels before the buying public. He also has a tendency to forget his more modest and less successful friends when they are no longer of use to him. In fact, his self-promotion is so blatant that ""when Roy lectured in some provincial town not a single copy of the books of the authors he had spoken of was ever asked for, but there was always a run on his own."" Bottom line (and end of Chapter 1): ""He was an examle of what an author can do, and to what heights he can rise, by industry, common sense, honesty, and the efficient combingation of means and ends. He was a good fellow and none but a cross-grained carper could grudge him his success."" (Indeed!!) I think this is a brilliant thought to end the Chapter 1.  Cammykitty: I sensed that you might have felt this novel set off on a tangent. Well, it all comes together soon as Maugham moves into the ""follies, vices, and stupidities"" in the literary scene who lionize a ""grand old man of letters"" who have risen by means maybe not as blatant as Kear, but who have risen all the same.

Plot: a boy/young man trains his dragon to fight, sometimes to the death. He has or gets a dragon he cares about, and travels, maybe to a city or something, must fight in an arena with his dragon (pokemon style). I also remember a scene of a dragon's throat being slit.

And, I'm also applying to graduate schools. If I actually get accepted I hope to start school in the fall. That should cut into my reading time as well.  As usual, I'm hoping to get a large amount of recommendations to add to the wish list -- books and travel destinations. I can't wait to see what everyone is reading this year.

Also I only have ONE class left before my Master's is complete and then I have that weight off my mind.  So as I said last year, I read lots and lots of young adult novels because I teach middle school English and work in the children's department at Barnes & Noble - and because they're fun and entertaining. But I've been feeling a little bogged down in them lately and hope that this year I can get back to my love of romance novels and adult scifi fantasy with a bit of mystery and non-fiction thrown in.  I hope to also spend a bit more time poking around here. I was an active member of lots of groups and threads a few years ago before grad school and teaching started sucking up all of my time. No longer sitting in a cubicle in front of my computer all day has really cut back on my chatting! But I hope to strike up some new reading friendships and renew some old ones.

Short review: A seemingly scientology-influenced work of mediocrity that somehow won the 1955 Hugo for Best Novel. Long review: After awarding the Hugo Award to The Demolished Man in 1953, the award was temporarily retired. Apparently everyone thought that the Hugos awarded at the 1953 Worldcon would be a one-time event as opposed to an annual affair. In 1955 the award was brought back after its short hiatus and the Best Novel Hugo was inexplicably awarded to They'd Rather Be Right (later renamed The Forever Machine). Why this turgid and pointless work of mediocrity won the Hugo remains a mystery, especially given that there were numerous far-superior alternatives available including Brain Wave by Poul Anderson, The Caves of Steel by Isaac Asimov, Earthman, Come Home by James Blish, Mission of Gravity by Hal Clement, and The Star Beast by Robert Heinlein. Hugo voters could have followed the International Fantasy Award and voted in favor of Edgar Pangborn's A Mirror for Observers. Or they could have even selected The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien. But no, they elected to choose a book so weak that it is the only Hugo winning novel to be allowed to go out of print for decades. (Note: In 1955 the selection process appears not to have been formalized fully, so there was no short list of competing nominees, this selection potential alternative winners is merely drawn from the array of other works of science fiction and fantasy published in 1955). One odd side effect of They'd Rather Be Right's Hugo win is that every now and then, when some enterprising writer decides to plunge into science fiction and read all the Hugo winners, they plough through the excellent 1953 winner The Demolished Man, write glowing praise for it, and then are never heard from again on the subject of science fiction. I am guessing that it is because they move on to this example of lousy writing and lose their verve. The story of They'd Rather Be Right is pretty straightforward, which is actually part of the problem with the book. A group of scientists create a thinking machine they call ""Bossy"", which causes public panic as everyone thinks that the machine will relegate humans to second class status. On that note, one has to wonder what sort of public relations failure one would have to engage in to name your thinking machine ""Bossy"" in the face of a panicky public. The novel opens with two of the scientists on the run, aided by a telepath named Joe Carter who hides them on skid row. They reassemble their machine and despite the fact that the machine was supposed to be designed to prevent airline crashes, they decide instead that the obvious thing to do is feed it a bunch of psychological data, hook it up to Mabel, their ex-prostitute landlady, and watch her become a young superpowered woman. If you think this doesn't make much sense, you're right. But the book was written to order as a serial appearing in Astounding Science Fiction for editor John Campbell, who by the time this work was being penned had already become a proponent of L. Ron Hubbard's ludicrously pseudoscientific Dianetics (going so far as to proclaim that Hubbard would win the Nobel Peace Prize for creating Scientology). How does this connect to They'd Rather Be Right one might ask. Well, when Bossy is connected to Mabel it ""cures"" her of old age by eliminating all of the false ideas she has, and replacing them with logical ones, leaving her more ethical, smarter, healthier, apparently immortal, and possessing of the power of telepathy. This process seems closely analogous with the Scientology practice of ""auditing"" a person to eliminate the ""reactive mind"" and ""thetans"", which proponents of Scientology claim will leave a person more ethical, more intelligent, immune to a host of illnesses, and eventually possessing of supernatural powers. This is not the only Scientology influenced element that the books seems to display. Hubbard's hatred of psychiatry is fairly public knowledge now, and it should come as no surprise that the sole psychiatrist character who appears in the novel is a dogmatic, venal character whose theories are quickly and easily dismissed by the clear-thinking Mabel. Whether Clifton and Riley inserted these sort of Scientology-like element as the centerpiece of their book because they were influenced by Hubbard, or influenced by the same sorts of popular thinking that inspired Hubbard, or simply because they knew that Campbell would like and and be more likely to buy their work, the fingerprints are there. The Scientology influence isn't all that drags this book into sub-mediocrity. Once Bossy has been assembled and its magical healing powers revealed, the plot, such as there is of one, just sort of peters out. Joe and the two professors turn to a wealthy industrialist for help in getting out from under Federal indictment because they assume that because he published an editorial in favor of Bossy he'd be sympathetic to their cause. And instead of any kind of plot twist developing, he is wholeheartedly on their side, even when it becomes apparent that he won't get what he wants out of the relationship. It turns out that one has to give up all of your prejudices and beliefs in order to benefit from the use of the machine, prompting Joe to state that most people wouldn't be willing to do this but would ""rather be right"". It also turns out that anyone who successfully goes through the procedure becomes telepathic, another development with hug potential implications that is left unexplored. Joe's aberrant telepathy is also a mystery, and since he is already a telepath, it seems that no one thinks that he should go through the Bossy based process. Apparently, if you are already a telepath, the possibility of becoming immortal isn't that enticing. Rather than examining what might happen if you had a society in which some people are effectively immortal and superpowered and others are not, the book ends just as the machines begin rolling off the assembly line. Instead of examining the effects of this sort of development, Clifton and Riley are pretty much content to have their cardboard characters lecture the reader about ""opinion control"" and give vague indications that the world is controlled by nebulous and yet pervasive public relations campaigns that, on a whim, can turn the populace on a dime. The one character who tries to undergo the process and fails simply resigns himself to the fact that he is destined to remain old and sick, which seems like an oddly listless reaction to what would probably be devastating news. This just highlights the fact that the ""character"" isn't really a character, but just a prop being used by the authors to make a point. Having made its argument in favor of Dianetics via computer interface, the book just ends. They'd Rather Be Right is widely regarded as the worst novel to ever win a Hugo Award. I'm not inclined to disagree with this assessment. Given that, it is not a terrible book, but rather a very formulaic piece of mediocre fiction overlaid with a veneer of poorly disguised Scientology. The book isn't even bad enough to be derided as enjoyably awful, it is just bland, dull, and uninteresting. Overall the experience of reading the tasteless blandness of They'd Rather Be Right is akin to eating stale white bread, and is an experience best to be avoided.

107189,This is the third time I will be trying to meet my 50 Book Challenge. I get so so close. Last year I read 48 books. If I just read a little while longer every night I might have been able to do it.  It really isn't how much you read it's the content. I have enjoyed reading all those 48 books last year. I have some books set aside that I hope to read this year.  The year is already flying by. It's already January 10. Where does the time go? I have yet to finish my first book of the year. I better get to it.     ,no
10719,"This is going to get really long, but I've been writing a lot recently about Kazuo Ishiguro's work, and I thought I would put my thoughts about the different novels on here for commentary. It's mostly about Never Let Me Go and When We Were Orphans, with healthy doses of An Artist of the Floating World and The Remains of the Day thrown in. On Never Let Me Go: Originally I was a little bit leery of Never Let Me Go. I had read Ishiguro's famous The Remains of the Day and his slightly less-famous An Artist of the Floating World, both of which I thought were masterful studies of regret and the loneliness of social hierarchies, of what happens to people who are trained and/or develop into a very specific social niche or pattern of behaviors, and who are then left behind by a changing world where that niche is no longer valued or even acceptable. The delicacy of the language and the perfection of the narrative voice and careful structure of the plot were all breathtaking. Nevertheless, I have to admit that I got a little dubious when I heard that Ishiguro's new book was a kind of semi-scifi dystopian novel. It was getting a lot of attention because it features cloning, that medical-ethics buzzword on the tips of everyone's tongues. Yes, it was snobbish to assume that ""current events"" and ""vaguely science-fiction plot"" equaled ""not so timeless as his other novels,"" but what can I say? I'm a snob. And now I'm a humbled snob, because Never Let Me Go is fantastic. Ishiguro's characteristically restrained understatement is a brilliant counterpoint to the potentially over-the-top plot line. It makes the dystopianism all the more believable, because, as we've all been taught by Pink Floyd via that blowhard Thoreau, ""hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way,"" and Ishiguro points out that it would still be the English way even if a complex system of forced organ donation were integrated into British society. But this was not a novel ""about"" a scary dystopian future. It's not a warning about what might be, not a tirade about the dangerous waters exposed by recent advances in medical science. Or, if it is these things, being so is not its primary aim. I'm really glad it wasn't the first Ishiguro novel I read, because having The Remains of the Day and Artist of the Floating World under my belt made me realize that the three novels share a concern about individuals who are used by society, who are forced or cajoled into surrendering their own fulfillment in order to serve others' needs, whether that be through a lifetime of faithful service, indoctrinated traditionalism, or being required to give up your vital organs so that someone else can live. All three novels explore the darker side of social hierarchies, of what is gained and lost by people who become invested in the myths of systems that may not be to their best interests. But all three also make the point that in order to confront the negative or oppressive aspects of a social system, people also have to compromise the images of beauty and understanding to which they have clung all their lives. In the case of The Remains of the Day, the butler Stevens is heavily invested in the value of the upper-class British lifestyle and his own role within it, and he is an old man before he is able to admit his regrets or even contemplate the possibility of a different life. An Artist of the Floating World has a protagonist whose memories of coming of age as an artist are inextricably bound with the rise of militant nationalism and oppression in Japan. In Never Let Me Go, young people whose lives are also drawing to an end have to choose between believing in the idyllic childhoods they enjoyed at a prestigious boarding school, and confronting the fact that during those childhoods they were objects of scorn and fear for most people, and also being manipulated for political purposes. The point I'm trying to make by drawing these connections between Ishiguro's novels is that Never Let Me Go is a metaphorical comment about current social hierarchies, or perhaps about the innate nature of human social hierarchies, rather than a warning about what might or might not happen at some point in the future. In every case, individuals are scarred by the ways in which society uses them as a tool rather than a sentient being, even while they also gain meaning and relevance from being so used. An Artist of the Floating World is especially interesting in this regard, since the manner in which the main character becomes a pawn of Japanese militarism takes place within a narrative of the independent artist, rebelling against parents and teachers to strike out in his own artistic direction - not a type of person that one expects to end up serving the entrenched power structures. Even so, Ono struggles between regret and self-justification about the role that he and his art have played in the leadup to the second World War, and has to reassess his place in a changing society. Never Let Me Go takes the theme of self-examination within the larger societal context to the next level; since the main characters are facing imminent death and have no children or family members that will be left behind (as in An Artist of the Floating World), there is no easy answer to the question ""Why bother to face the truth about this culture or our role within it?"" There is no question that the easier path is to sink into an abyss of nostalgia, remembering happy days rather than dwelling on harsh realities. Take away the usual motivating factors for facing hard truths (it will allow you to lead a better, more honest life, or make a better life for those you love), and the novel becomes a fascinating meditation on the dilemma of seeking out the truth, versus remaining in blissful ignorance. Some characters choose one path, and others choose the other; I was left at the end of the novel asking myself if either group was really better off. My whole being rebels against the idea that striving for the right is useless because we're all going to die anyway, and I think that Ishiguro would object to this idea as well, but he definitely takes his reader through a hard and unflinching look at why one ought to search out the truth, when the usual answers don't apply. I also think the layers of social knowledge and naivete in Ishiguro's novels are fascinating. They mostly deal with people who are operating below the surface, behind the scenes: a butler, with his intimate knowledge of how to keep a huge upper-class household in top working order; an artist, creating propaganda that bolsters a gathering political storm; a group of young people who belong to the shunned ""donor"" class, about whom regular citizens know very little but on whom they depend for replacement organs. You would think that each of these people would be possessed of inside information, that they could give us a glimpse behind the scenes, into the clockwork that makes society tick. And to a certain extent this is true. But to a greater extent, reading the books makes me realize that to people in their situation, the world I consider normal is ""behind the scenes,"" and knowing more about their own realm of influence only means that there are other aspects of life about which they are naive. So, for example, the donors know very little about the prevailing attitudes towards them in the outside world, just as the English butler has trouble conceiving of a life not selflessly dedicated to service. It's an interesting revelation, that absolute knowledge resides in no one person, but is a mosaic of (often conflicting) experiences from across the social spectrum. All of this is more fun to read than I'm communicating. Ishiguro has an amazing ability to maintain complete control of his narrative at all times, making it all seem breezily simple while juggling complicated past-and-present plots and telling the story from a very subjective, sometimes unreliable first-person perspective which never falters in its consistency. I can only imagine that for anyone who appreciates the art of novel-writing, the experience of reading one of his books is just as breathtaking as it is for me. On When We Were Orphans: I'm on a major Ishiguro bender. Since I wrote a few weeks ago about his newest novel, Never Let Me Go, my enthusiasm has only grown; in fact, I just finished When We Were Orphans, which was every bit as intriguing as the other three of his I've read (Never Let Me Go, The Remains of the Day and An Artist of the Floating World). As always, the act of narration takes front and center position in When We Were Orphans - I think Ishiguro has got to be the master of using the unreliable (or at least highly subjective) narrator to great effect. In The Remains of the Day there are some scenes that truly take the breath away with their ability to juggle multiple subjectivities while still telling a story that, while multi-layered, is riveting on its most basic level as well. So, for example, there is a scene in which Miss Kenton, the semi-impetuous housekeeper, comes to ""bother"" Stevens in his study while he's reading a novel, and there is a moment of acute sexual tension between them, except that Stevens (the first-person voice) both refuses to acknowledge such things as ""sexuality"" to his readers, and may not even understand himself the attraction he felt. In addition, the entire episode is told in flashback, with the past Stevens holding a different set of attitudes and opinions toward the events than the present Stevens. There is also a plotline in the present day which is influencing the moods of Stevens the narrator, and past embarrassment about the novel in question, which adds a certain huffiness to the demeanor of the man, both past and present. Through all of these prismatic narrative challenges, Ishiguro manages to tell a story that is elegant and affecting, as well as communicating, through the reticent and muddled eyes of Stevens, a clear portrait of Miss Kenton's motivations and emotions. No mean feat, obviously. In When We Were Orphans, Ishiguro's trademark unreliable narrator is used to excellent advantage in the way that the novel plays off of the detective genre, creating an amazing experience for the reader by turning the whole idea of a whodunit on its head. Usually, the detective in any given mystery novel is the ultimate word in veracity: if he or she says it, you can believe it. Extreme examples of this phenomenon are many of Sherlock Holmes' cases, in which Holmes professes to know the solution to the case before he and Watson even start investigating - he's more just trying to tie up a few loose ends, and then he'll reveal everything to us. But Christopher Banks, the ostensibly great detective in Ishiguro's novel, is wildly unreliable, constantly overlooking the obvious, insisting on the ludicrous, and attempting to paint a picture of himself that's at odds with the memories of seemingly every person he runs across in the course of the novel. Over and over, although he insists on his own social acumen, he meets old acquaintances and classmates who remember him as ""a miserable loner"" or ""an odd duck"" - claims to which he takes startled exception (""You must have me confused with someone else, old chap. I was always one for mucking in.""). Likewise, when he remembers or encounters anyone who expresses compassion about his orphanhood (his parents are kidnapped when he is a child), he reacts with brusque annoyance. These character quirks are rendered mysterious rather than absurd or amusing, by the fact that there are also people who do seem to take Banks seriously - he's not simply a deluded maniac believing himself to be a great detective. There are instances that seem to corroborate almost positively certain claims that Banks makes at one time or another, and other passages where he does seem genuinely perceptive and honest, balancing out his more outlandish moments. The interplay between these elements leaves the reader floating along on a superbly-crafted bed of quicksand, always unsure quite what to believe, which events Banks has reported accurately, and why or in what ways he has been inaccurate. Banks' own frustrated description of the citizens of Shanghai could equally well be a description of his own narrative style: ""People here seem determined at every opportunity to block one's view. No sooner has one entered a room or stepped out of a car than someone or other will have smilingly placed himself right within one's line of vision, preventing the most basic perusal of one's surroundings. Often as not, the offending person is one's very host or guide of that moment..."" Generally, murder mysteries are only interesting until the detective reveals the solution, pointed out carefully by all the clues. After that, all the ends have been tied up neatly and the reader is no longer held to the story. But in this case, the novel remains fascinating long after finishing it, because the reader is never quite sure what actually happened, what motivated the characters, or, more importantly for the book itself, the larger ramifications of those events. Not that this uncertainty is ever down to poor writing or simple lack of character development - far from it. Instead, it is as if the possible realities of Banks' life are refracted through the prism of his perception, and Ishiguro somehow manages to communicate many interwoven possibilities via one impressive narration, leaving the reader to draw her own conclusions or simply wander forever among the potential choices. Like Ishiguro's other novels, When We Were Orphans has much to say about British and Japanese imperialism - in this case, the British occupation and Japanese invasion of Shanghai and mainland China in the first half of the twentieth century. Being far from an expert on the history of foreign aggression in eastern China, I can't break down the political allegory in any detail, but I do think that Ishiguro paints a brilliant portrait of the surreal self-involvement of the occupying British society, still putting on dinner parties and hosting events while a war rages around them. Christopher Banks' own insistence that finally ""solving the case"" of his parents' disappearance will somehow bring an end to the Sino-Japanese conflict is an excellent metaphor for the egregiously inflated self-importance of the declining British Empire. And the scene in which Banks stumbles upon his childhood home, now almost unrecognizable and occupied by a Chinese family who have spent years dreading his return, is a poignant and bizarre reminder of the literal effects of an ""occupying force."" But not only do these scenes make for fascinating political commentary; they are also gripping and beautifully told on a literal level, and the atmospheric prose contributes to a craftsmanly web of suspense surrounding Banks' narration. When We Were Orphans is what I always wanted mystery novels to be: intriguing, insightful, ambiguous, atmospheric and amazingly well-written, ending with some ends tied in surprising places, and some still dangling enticingly in the reader's mind. I've heard that the next Ishiguro novel on my shelf, The Unconsoled, takes ambiguity and strangeness to a whole other level, and I'm delighted at the prospect of continuing and expanding my Ishigurophilia. I'm sure y'all will hear about it when I do.",no

Otherwise, I'm going to put them into series, so that if they have no author or are attributed to different authors, it will be possible to find them all in one place.

Creidhe of ""Foxmask"" can't read, but she can weave stories and make colors.

107448,"Welcome to the Controller's Monthly Note Dear All I hope you managed to catch a good deal of The Genius of Mozart over the past weeks. There has been an overwhelmingly positive response to the season. It's been a unique opportunity for total immersion in his music, to hear the many pieces which are seldom played, and also to hear legendary performances of his masterpieces. I have learned a huge amount throughout the last 12 days and I am not surprised that so many of you have asked us to carry on the celebration! Don't forget, by the way, that you can still catch a lot of the Mozart programming by using the iPlayer. You can best access the iPlayer streams via the programme pages on the Radio 3 website. Mozart also provides us with a moment to contemplate genius and the nature of musical intelligence, so we have offered the chance for you to understand your own musicality better. Do go online and explore our new test for musicality, as well as recommending it to your friends. I've done it myself (rather scarily with some colleagues looking on) and found it a stimulating experience. To take the test, again. just go to the Radio 3 website. Throughout The Genius of Mozart, I have really appreciated hearing many insights into the composer's world. The Mozart objects introduced by Cliff Eisen are still available as downloads, so you can easily access those you have missed. These short vignettes presented an intriguing selection of artefacts from portraits to a model of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and from pianos to an executioners sword, as well as a window from Mozarts Vienna flat. On the subject of podcasts, I hope many of you have discovered and are enjoying the Specialist Classical Chart weekly download which has been available since November. It's a brief segment from our Tuesday breakfast programme, and provides a good way of keeping up to date with the latest recordings and hearing the music which is proving popular among other music-lovers. You can find links to all our downloads on the Radio 3 Homepage. BEYOND MOZART We have now resumed our normal schedule, and have an exciting weekend ahead. In Music Matters on Saturday at 12.15pm, Tom Service is visiting the twin cultural cities of Tallinn and Turku in Estonia and Finland, comparing these cultural centres on either side of the Baltic with their different histories. On Saturday evening we continue our broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera with Verdis ever popular La traviata, in which Marina Poplavskaya and Matthew Polenzani are the ill-fated lovers. These productions have a loyal following, and I imagine that will be particularly the case on Saturday since the chief conductor of the BBC Philharmonic, Gianandrea Noseda, will be conducting. Later on Saturday night, Here and Now reflects the UK's leading contemporary music festival, which is based in Huddersfield. For the next five weeks we have highlights from the 2010 Festival, including world premires from Brian Ferneyhough and UK premires from the festival's composer-in-residence Rebecca Saunders. There are also some reports on unusual events, such as a concert on a train and a 12-hour performance of John Cage. On Sunday evening we have a specially commissioned play by Carlo Gebler, which talks of the relationship between Charles and Mary Lamb, the brother and sister who wrote The Tales of Shakespeare, first published in 1807 and still in print. The drama exposes the tragic circumstances of their lives, and how poverty and stress drove Mary to commit a shocking crime, murdering her mother. And on Monday, Sibelius is our Composer of the Week. The great Finnish composer had a very powerful creative period and then put down his pen abruptly, at the height of his powers, living out the rest of his life quietly in his home in the forests near Helsinki. Donald Macleod explores this story, and presents some new insights. Our ideas programme Night Waves resumes this week, and I am looking forward to hearing the veteran philosopher Mary Midgely in conversation with Philip Dodd. This was recorded at The Sage, Gateshead as part of our Free Thinking festival in November. At 91 years old, Mary Midgley remains one of the most forthright minds in Britain today, strongly contesting the claim of science to have answered all the most important questions about existence. MUSIC PLANET Our next major initiative - Music Planet - runs parallel to a major series produced by our colleagues in television, Human Planet on BBC One. It also marks the return of Andy Kershaw to Radio 3. The first Radio 3 episode, broadcast yesterday evening (Thursday 13 January) at 9pm, is available on the iPlayer for a week, and deals with the music of ocean communities, from Galicia to Papua New Guinea, Brazil and the Solomon Islands. The programme is also repeated on Radio 3 on Saturday 15 Jan at 3pm. Next Thursdays programme will explore music from desert communities around the world. Andy has travelled to southern Algeria to admire the beauty of the vast desert and the music it has inspired. Meanwhile, Lucy Duran has travelled deep into the Gobi Desert, where a studio was set up in a traditional Mongolian tent to record different types of desert song, including some extraordinary throat singing. The following week (January 27th) we move from the desert to the frozen Arctic, as Andy and Lucy go in search of music from some of the world's remotest places and peoples. In Greenland Lucy greets the New Year with music and meets the land's most famous singer, while Andy in Norway goes reindeer hunting under the midnight sun and explorers the traditional singing style of the yoik. The programme also takes in the Inuit culture of Canada, as well as Siberia where Andy meets musicians from the coldest city on Earth, who while away the long winter nights with the help of Jews harps. Looking ahead, 14th March is a date for your diaries. Radio 3's spectacular Big Red Nose Show will be raising money for Comic Relief. Hosted by Katie Derham at the Royal Albert Hall, the BBC Concert Orchestra is joined by stars from the world of classical music and comedy including Nicola Benedetti, Sue Perkins, Julian Lloyd Webber, Marcus Brigstocke, Tim Vine, Basil Brush and many more.

Thank you to all who took part by requesting music and responding in other ways. Your feedback, in particular to Play Mozart for Me, Sara Mohr-Pietsch's late night request programme, reminds me of the power of music and of radio to move and inspire audiences.

The Little boy 'Ignorance' was hanging in the crowd while King Ego paraded up and down. Any thing could be pointed out and what is more I'd just finished Peter Carey's ""Parrot and Olivier In America"" and I didn't understand what it was about. Sure I enjoyed it and I'd read the blurb but had no idea how to cook the meat of the story. So I flipped to the Guardian on Line (http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jan/30/peter-carey-parrot-olivier-america) and was relieved to find Ursula K Le Guin having the same experience and anything good for Ursula is good enough for Sean. Although I will say that while reading Carey's new novel I kept remembering 'The Sot Weed Factor' and if I was a eager student of Literature with the pleasure of daily strolls beneath the green canopies of higher learning I'd be looking for further discourse on the parallels and perpendicularities (if it's a word how do you spell it?) etc etc ...

108420,"Since this discussion has been unhelpfully placed on Pro and Con (Religion), where it is simply attracting vituperation, I have copied it here. If I have the time, I shall try to post a response. Some felt my comments on another thread had something to do with the role of gays in the Roman Catholic Church. After much go round I commented: ""The problem is that the issue is not the one you are passionately defending."" ""Then what is the issue?' Jesse asked. I responded by saying those who felt the recognition of gay culture in the US or the world or their passionately held homosexualist views wouldn't understand the very specific challenges in the Catholic church. That is open to the charge of being a put down so I thought I would at least demonstrate what I mean, even though I feel the topic is only of relevance to Roman Catholics as it is so narrow in its scope. The problem, simply stated is that for a Catholic Homosexualist to exist they would need to deny one of the articles of the Creed, namely ""We look for the resurrection of the dead."" ""Catholics believe in a special connection between themselves and their bodies. Without their bodies they are not really complete. Catholics also believe that God made them to live with him forever, not in disembodied souls, but in the glorified body raised up in the resurrection on the last day. what you believe about life after death depends very much on what you believe about God. If God exists, and if God has destined us for eternal life, then there is really no problem about the means for self-conscious experience. God will provide them. At the death of the body and before the general resurrection, God is fully capable of providing the means by which we enjoy his presence. No doubt this will be very unlike the way we now experience Catholics also believe that the human person is a mysterious unity of matter and spirit. There is part of us that is extended in three dimensions and takes up space: this we call matter. But there is another facet of the unity we are which cannot be thought of in that way; this is the part of us we call spirit. Scripture says that God breathed life into lifeless matter, and that image of breath and life is most appropriate to the nature of spiritual being. The human spirit animates matter, gives it what vital energy and gathers it into a living organic unity. That is what God created it to do. Thus Catholics believe that a human spirit exists for a body; it was made to exist in matter as its life-giving principle. This means that all those parts of human life that seem most essentially spiritual, like knowing and choosing also involve the body; the spirit experiences through the body. And so human life involves a most intimate relation between these two sides of our being: matter needs spirit to bind it into a functioning unity; spirit needs matter to release its potential for pursuing and enjoying all the goods, moral and intellectual, proper to human life. That is why Catholics look forward to the resurrection of the body. It is part of their belief that the soul without the body is incomplete; that the full and complete person is present on the last day when matter and spirit, transformed and redeemed, are joined together in the resurrection of the just."" Peter Kreeft, The Handbook of Christian Apologetics So when Jesus called upon his followers to Repent the Kingdom of God is at hand, we were called upon to repent our sins for the effect they have on our bodies which will be the eternal resting place for our beautiful souls. If we so scar ourselves during our time on earth, we wont fulfill our destinies. Homosexualism actively calls upon homosexuals to indulge in homosexual acts and argues that their goodness is in no way different from Heterosexual acts. Doesnt this contradict Catholic Teaching and specifically the article all Catholics recite in the Creed? I can think of nothing more fundamental to the understanding of who we are (from a Christian anthropological point of view) than the idea that we are Embodied Persons. John Paul IIs Theology of the Body is a remarkable vision that builds on this Catholic doctrine. Dr.David L. Schindler begins an essay by defining six characteristics of it which I have separated out and presented on my blog. Respond to the article on embodied persons and show me how Homosexualism embraces or reconciles these beliefs and how it is possible for a Homosexualist Catholic to remain within the Church or even be Christian. I will not respond to opinion or pronouncements. Note the stress on reconciliation. Note that it has nothing to do with ""fairness"" or gays in the general population or high school girls posting youtube videos of their coming out before school assemblies. If you deal legitimately with the article and deal with the role of gays in the Church suggested by it I will respond to you. I look forward to your responses. dj  That is, user DJ808. ",no

108571,"The Double by Jose Saramago Tertuliano Maximo Afonso, a mild-mannered history teacher, is thunderstruck when he sees an exact duplicate of himself playing a bit part in the video of a B-grade movie he is watching. This ""double"" becomes his obsession, and Tertuliano, after several arguments with his Common Sense (which Common Sense lost) decides he must confront the double. His methodic, systematic search for the double is described in minute detail by an authorial narrator who from time to time inserts himself into the narrative to provide writing tips (""Those words, Nothing Happened, are used when there is an urgent need to move on to the next incident or when, for example, one does not quite know what to do with the character's own thoughts, especially if they bear no relation to the existential milieu in which the character is supposed to live and work. The teacher and fledging lover of videos, Tertuliano Maximo Afonso, is in precisely this situation as he is driving his car. He was in fact thinking, a lot and very intensely, but his thoughts bore so little relevance to the last twenty-four hours he had just lived that if we were to take them into account and include them in this novel, the story we had decided to tell would inevitably have to be replaced by another....This would mean declaring all our hard work, these forty or so dense, difficult pages null and void....""), as well as some heavy-handed forboding (""It will not be long before we discover the tragic consequences of leaving unexcavated a second-world-war bomb in the belief that it was too old to explode."" ""Too late my friend, too late, you've opened Pandora's box and now you have to live with the consequences....""). This searching part of the book goes on perhaps a tad too long, but the novel really takes off when Tertuliano and his double begin to parry with each other. The novel then moves quickly to an unexpected ending. Written in what I believe is Saramago's characteristic style--long run-on sentences, little punctuation, paragraphs that are pages long-- the novel is nevertheless easy to read, and very, very enjoyable.",no

109029,"Hello out there, I was wondering if anyone could identify with me regarding a problem I have. I've always loved books, not news to people on this site I'm sure!  The problem is that I have trouble with actually reading the books I buy, with the exception of westerns and science fiction. Those are easy reads and I can read all night if it grips me.  When I'm in a bookstore, online, or other book venue, I feel somehow connected to the books. It's like some sort of Zen. I've never had a friend, my wife, or anyone else who could outlast me in a bookstore when I'm in this mode. I have this feeling like I really want to know what's in this book I'm buying. The problem is that I end up shelving it after I buy it and then feel guilty as time goes on and I never actually read it. Or I start to read it, but my attention doesn't stay with the book. I'm 38 and have books from the early 90's that I have kept with me through many moves, but have never read. Or I read it then, but haven't read it again, and want to. I have this semi-hoarding mentality that I hate to get rid of these books when I still have some interest in reading them. Recently I have had a little progress with reading classic novels that I've had a while, but that's still not nonfiction. One thing that I've done in the past few years is to not buy more books until I read ones that I will get rid of to avoid having too many.

The limits of fifteen-year-old Kambili's world are defined by the high walls of her family estate and the dictates of her repressive and fanatically religious father. Her life is regulated by schedules: prayer, sleep, study, and more prayer. When Nigeria begins to fall apart during a military coup, Kambili's father, involved mysteriously in the political crisis, sends Kambili and her brother away to live with their aunt.

Some of the artwork is richly detailed, while other artwork is bright and simplistically comic book-like.

I don't remember many details about the story, I'm afraid, but I can recall was pretty vivid. The boy's dog was a family pet and very friendly. The dog had been stolen when the boy and an older family member of his went into a convenience store, left the dog casually tied in the back of their pick-up truck, and returned to find the dog gone. The boy eventually figured out that the dog had been stolen by a group of people who trained and sold dogs as attack dogs, and they used very cruel, abusive methods to make the dogs vicious, like fill waterguns with ammonia and squirt the dogs in the eyes. The boy even managed to go undercover at the training facility by getting a job there so that he could snope around. The boy was fairly young, 12ish to 15ish. I don't believe he was old enough to drive. I'm pretty sure the dog was female, and it was a plot point in the book that she was a very pretty dog of unusual color, like solid black or solid white. There were a couple of lines of text about the owner of the attack-dog facility was unhappy that his underling had stolen an unusually colored dog because they were so distinctive and didn't the underling remember all the attention they had accidentally gathered the last time they stole an unusually colored dog? I'm pretty sure the dog was a German Shepherd but, if she wasn't, she was some other breed of large dog popular as an attack dog, like a pit bull or a Doberman. The evil trainers might have been racists as well as abusive to animals, the boy might have been Hispanic, and the police might have supported the boy as he worked undercover to help break up the whole training operation (not just find the one stolen dog). ...But my mind might have invented those details.

The analysis in class proved that Hemingway used a LOT of symbols in his story...I would never have thought you can discover so much symbolism in such a short novel...rated 2 1/2*...I know it's not much and I did like his use of symbolism during the analysis but the story just couldn't really appeal to me as much as Steinbeck's did) William Golding Lord of the flies (Read and analysed in class - very good story about the fall of man and how a group of boys who are stranded on an island try to build up a civilisation at first but eventually give in to their primitive nature and become savage. I'd rate 3 1/2*:)) Saul Bellow Seize the day (Read and analysed in class - this one was a dissapointment to me, I just couldn't get into the story. Rated 1*) J.M. Coetzee Disgrace Subject: Realism Charles Dickens Hard Times (paused) George Eliot Middlemarch  (read and analysing in class - see full review below) William Dean Howells A hazard of new fortunes Henry James Portrait of a Lady Subject: Postmodernism Jonathan Coe What a carve up!  (read and analysed in class - a very entertaining read about a rich and influential family who gathered their fortune by stealing, lying, committing fraude etc. and an author who has the assignment of writing a book about their various acts of crime. In doing so he also gathers information about an unsolved murder and the more his book advances the more mysteries are being unravelled...rated ***) Don DeLillo White Noise  (Read and analysing in class - didn't think it was very special.

10980,"Perhaps it's best to begin with Jorge Luis Borges--a kind of a crossroads in some ways between Kafka and Joyce. In Borges world there is the exploration of the world of dreams and limitlessness but curiously a kind of secular universe or one where the gatekeeper (or God) has gone missing. There is a compelling though very perceptive and articulate randomness to his subject matter. Of all his works it's his poetry I like the best but Ficciones and or Labyrinths to me would be the best place to start with his prose which is either in short story or essayistic form. I see echoes of his style in a number of very important writers from around the globe--particularly Italo Calvino, Juan Rulfo, Augusto Monterroso and his fellow Argentinian Adolfo Bioy Casares and more contemporaneously Alvaro Mutis. His work is integral and a huge influence to the Latin Boom coming out of the 50's, 60's and 70's which produced the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Julio Cortazar and Alejo Carpentier amongst others.  The polyglot nature of Argentine society rivals the United States. While immigrants flocked from Europe in their millions in the 19th century to North America (and that includes Canada) many also chose a South American destination and in particular Argentina which drew many from Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Eastern Europe. They brought their cultural identifications and languages which have assimilated into the broader culture of the Argentine people at large. One first generation immigrant of a Swiss mother and a German father was Roberto Arlt whose The seven madmen which was later followed up with Los lanzallamas describes in a noirist and very Dostoyevskian kind of fashion the alienation of a man within his own culture and can be seen as a precursor to the existentialist writings that will come into popularity worldwide some 10 to 20 years later. His main character--one Remo Erdosain--stumbles around Buenos Aires from one catastrophe to another--finally linking up with one of the more sinister characters I've ever run into in novel form who is known as 'The Astrologer' who by hook or by crook and meaning to use any ideology that fits his purpose plans with his cohorts on staging a coup d'etat to take over the government and establish a ruthless dictatorship run on fear. These two works published in 1929 and 1931 retrospectively seem to eerily point out the direction that the most meglomaniac dictatorial regimes (particulary Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia) will take in the 20th century. As for the Latin Boom mentioned above--Julio Cortazar is without any doubt the most famous Argentine representative--his Hopscotch set in Paris and Buenos Aires owes something to both Borges and Joyce. One of the most ambitious pieces of fiction--it leaves much open to interpretation--and tempts the reader to read its chapters in any order he sees fit to find his own meaning. Among other works of his are the novel 62: A model kit and short story collections All fires the fire and End of the game.  Another significant Boom writer would be Luisa Valenzuela who has ties also to the French new novel and Tel Quel movements. Later on her Strange things happen here will give some insight into the death and disappearances of some of those opposed  to the Isabella Peron regime. At this point I will bring up the poet Juan Gelman a political exile whose son Marcelo and pregnant daughter in law Maria Claudia disappeared during the time of the Argentine dirty war--1976-1983. Many years later a barrel containing the remains of Marcelo will wash up along the River Plate. The body of Maria Claudia has never been accounted for and until 2000 the whereabouts of the daughter that was born to her was unknown--at which time it was found that she adopted by people loyal to the military regime. The dirty war informs a lot of the fiction by writers from the 1970's on particularly the excellent Ricardo Piglia whose Artificial Respiration is IMO maybe the best book to come out of Latin America in the 20th century. A novel on one hand it is also a philosophical and intellectual look at the meaning of existence and the right of an individual to forge his own way in a society that intimidates and stymies him every step of the way.  For now I'm going to take a break and later on come back with a Part II to this because I'm having some difficulty with the site on this.",no

As I wrap up a Ph.D., Ive begun to fantasize about a modern U.S. course that has Indians at the center of the story. Usually, of course, Indians are of little significance from the Revolution to Wounded Knee, and they leave the stage entirely at that point."" Urqhart: ""I would love to have Muscogulus start a thread ... and clarify what he is saying."" OK.  When I say Indians are (usually) of little significance, I'm talking about historiography  the writing of history  rather than actual historical events.  The neglect of Indians as fully human historical actors is a textbook example of reading history backwards. Because Indians had been pushed to the margins of U.S. society by 1900  and given the erstwhile explanatory power of racial science and the frontier thesis (The frontier in American history), which tacitly assumed Indians and whites were mutually exclusive  it seemed that decline and disappearance were the Indians destiny.  So for a long time the historians job concerning Indians was merely to narrate how the rise of the United States occasioned the fall of the doomed red man. The great literary historians of the 1800s did this beautifully. In the 20th century, though, racialist ideas became associated with fascism and gradually fell out of favor. Mostly.  As a consequence, historians seem to have found less reason for keeping Indians in U.S. histories at all. If youll permit me to exaggerate for effect  once we became uncomfortable with triumphing over Indians, we ran out of things to write concerning them.  # The Indian-sized holes were especially obvious in colonial history. After all, 1492-1775 was the era when Indians still outnumbered white and black newcomers to North America, and Indians were a constant presence in colonists life. But you wouldnt know it if you read most colonial histories from between, lets say, World War II and the 1990s.  This situation was untenable, because so many of the primary colonial documents are concerned with Indians: trade with Indians, meetings with Indian diplomats, making war with and against Indians, weighing rumors about Indians intentions, etc. Indians own discourse was preserved only through transcribed remarks by interpreters, and a few English writings by Christian converts. These sources got little enough attention, until recently.  Not that historians were being lazy:  * For most mid-century historians, one gets a sense that all this Indian matter was petty and unseemly, detracting from important questions of the New England mind or the liberal tradition or what have you.  * For radical historians, the same material was a searing indictment of white racism. But the focus was on what white people did to innocent Indian victims, merely inverting the monochrome color scheme of traditional frontier history while keeping the Indians more or less passive. At its best, this work challenged age-old assumptions of Indian inferiority and contributed to the present-oriented manifestos of the Indian rights movement. Vine Deloria Jr. made major contributions to both scholarship and politics.  * For social historians, busily anatomizing the vital records of local colonial societies, there just wasnt enough data to work with concerning Indian groups, so they kept their focus on Anglo colonists. The Chesapeake school of historians was busy pushing the scope of research beyond New England, reinstating Jamestown to its place in the vanguard of English settlement (e.g. in The Chesapeake in the Seventeenth Century). But even historical archaeologists of the Chesapeake (as in the classic popular work Here Lies Virginia) often managed to be dense about interpreting evidence related to Indians. (I think it was Ivor Nol Hume who described a 70s-era museum diorama in which a little window directed the viewers gaze down a rifle barrel aimed at a dummy of an Indian in some woods. Even Nol Hume allowed that this was not an ideal way to interpret the past.)  * For Atlantic world researchers, there was more than enough to do in researching the European populations of North America, including the enemy French and Spanish, and other non-English-speaking immigrants. They were also putting the triangular trade between Europe, Africa, and the Americas under a microscope, amassing as much detail as possible about the importation of enslaved Africans. So there was no question but that they were keeping busy as well.  Besides, the insignificance of Indians has been a major premise of Anglo-American thought since before the Founding. In brief, the disappearance of Indians has been forecast for centuries, with each new generation expecting complete extinction and/or assimilation to take place Real Soon Now. (Ill skip the Why and How questions.) The perpetual failure of this prophecy has made it more and more difficult to keep regarding Indians as insignificant.  It has taken time, though, to bring this Insignificance Theory to full consciousness, and then to subject it to criticism. Im spending so much time on colonial history because I propose that this field is where the process first took place. (Im also ignoring some old historical works that are still worth reading (e.g. by Angie Debo and H.S. Halbert), because these were exceptions that prove the rule.)  So what has happened since the late 1980s? It has become all but impossible to write colonial history without taking Indians seriously as historical actors. First Ill describe how this happened, then Ill drop the names of some exemplary recent books.  First, historians disproved the child of the forest stereotype of Indians, while also proving the indispensability of Indian production and consumption to the colonial Atlantic economy. Indians harvested and sold furs and skins that ended up in metropolitan markets, and they bought manufactured goods originating in Europe, as well as imported staples like coffee and sugar.  The earliest book I know of on this subject, Indians in the Fur Trade, used Hudsons Bay Company records alongside ethnographic evidence. This 1974 book, from a Canadian press, is a tour de force, and it took more than a decade for the implications to migrate south of the Saint Lawrence River.  A book that knit the southern Indians into the Atlantic economy is Kathryn Braunds Deerskins and Duffels (1993), recently out in a new edition. Almost simultaneously, Daniel H. Usner Jr. ushered economic history into the lower Mississippi valley with Indians, Settlers, and Slaves in a Frontier Exchange Economy (1992).  The idea of constant, informal frontier exchange between red, white, and black people builds on a concept from James H. Merrells 1989 book about the Catawba Indians of the Carolinas, The Indians New World. He proposed that historians emphasize similarities in the experience of colonists and natives, rather than approaching them as generically different types of people.  Merrells other big idea, which seems obvious in hindsight, was to point out that Indians, like the European newcomers, had an old world of well established cultural patterns that persisted in the new world of trans-Atlantic exchange. Merrells paradigm has much more explanatory power than the old, semi-conscious paradigm that explained Indians divergence from European cultural patterns as a result of their primitive nature  or for more recent historians, their different stage of development, a milder way of expressing the same assumption.  The Indians old world (also the title of a 1996 article by Neal Salisbury in William and Mary Quarterly) transformed the significance of several flattering old tales of contact, such as the sale of Manhattan Island for twenty-four dollars in trinkets, and the rescue of John Smith by a lovesick Indian princess. (For the latter, see Powhatans World and Colonial Virginia, or almost any more recent book on the Virginia Algonquians. John Smith was supposed to understand that his English tribe was being adopted as fictive kin of the Algonquians. Possibly he did understand, but retold the story in a way that suited his aims for English readers.) Among the most impressive works in this category, to me, is Patricia Kay Galloways Choctaw Genesis.  Another branch of recent scholarship applies Indian norms to colonial politics, showing how Indians initially defined the ground rules of diplomacy in North America. But as more and more Europeans swarmed to the New World, the balance between indigenous and imported norms was constantly being renegotiated. Richard White (now one of our leading historians of the U.S. West) brilliantly interpreted the history of the Great Lakes region, the terre en haut, with his 1991 book The Middle Ground. The only downside to this book is the response it excited from some historians, who started finding middle grounds everywhere they looked, applying Whites paradigm with far less sensitivity than White did. (To me it was a small echo of the Foucauldian fad in the social sciences and literature.) Quite simply, The Middle Ground is a masterpiece that defies brief summary. Read it.  So by the mid-1990s, traditional colonial history was under siege from several compelling new strands of scholarship that took Indians seriously  as economic producers and consumers, as cultural people with their own old world, as sophisticated political people who could impose their norms on Europeans, and as fully human people with everyday experiences shared by (and comparable to those of) European settlers and African slaves. Documentary sources strengthened these paradigms, and historical archaeology brought new insights into the lives of people who left no documents.  I imagine Francis Parkman turning uneasily in his grave.  In the last 15 years or so, the paradigm of Indian significance has rejuvenated colonial history, as well as that of the American Revolution. Fred Andersons Crucible of War did a famously successful job of making the Seven Years War coherent. (How many of us grew up with only the vaguest idea of a series of interchangeable French and Indian wars before the Revolution?) Crucible of War takes the motives of a Seneca headman as seriously as those of Frederick the Great, and that is a key to its interpretive brilliance.  Other outstanding studies of this period in the Northeast include At the Crossroads and Our Savage Neighbors. Im partial to Behind the Frontier, about Indians in eastern Massachusetts, but I understand that the author has published more wide-ranging research since then.  The drastic change in Anglo attitudes toward the Crown from the early 1760s (love, pride) to the 1770s (distrust, rage) demand an explanation, and its hard to find one without taking Indians seriously. So for instance Forced Founders, by Woody Holton, argues that the Virginia founders were led into rebellion by the actions of common folk of every skin tone. South of Virginia, the Revolution was accompanied by an invasion of the Cherokee country with the stated aim of exterminating the people. (It seems that one of the three main dialects of Cherokee went extinct because of this war.) This didnt happen by accident, and The Dividing Paths is one attempt to explain it.  So colonial historians have dismissed the Insignificance Theory, and their findings have even had time to leach into popular history, classrooms, textbooks  it might even be working its way into that redoubt of glittering historical obtuseness, The History Channel. ;-) The next frontier (so to speak) is to take Indians seriously in all the other eras of American history. This cant be easy, because Americans have age-worn habits of circular thought about Indians.  To take just one example: All Indians are poor Indians, and accumulating wealth is inconsistent with Indian ways. So if Indians get rich, either (a) they are not real Indians, or (b) they are being manipulated or cheated by non-Indians. Ergo, all real Indians are poor Indians. Q.E.D. This is embarrassingly illogical, of course, and it rests on no evidence. But as a semi-conscious thought process, it is more than sufficient to generate inertia.  This is too long, but it still is not a comprehensive answer to Urqharts question. (Paging Dr. Crosby....)

Here's what he knows about it...it appeared on some ""Top 200"" book list although he's not sure which one. It's vaguely about WWII and the Pacific. It could be based on the author's own experience, but he thinks that it's literature and not an autobiography. It might have been published in the 1950s, but he's really not sure.  Vague eh? It was a book an exgirlfriend recommended and they are no longer are terms for him to be able to ask her.  I can only come up with Norman Mailer's ""The Naked and the Dead"" or ""The Caine Mutiny."" Anyone else have ideas? Thanks!",yes

The Mexican Free-Tail Bats have come back in great numbers from their wintering spot south of the border. They're nesting in the gaps of the highway overpass about a mile from our house. When they come out around sunset, they look like roiling black clouds as they fly off to the east. This year, a band of militant Minute Man* hawks have followed them to their hideout, so you as you watch this spectacular display of a coordinated exodus from beneath the bridge, you also see a few on the perimeter - the slower ones - get picked off. Somehow, I don't think they get turned over to the Border Patrol hawks*. * As far as I know, neither of these species of hawk are officially recognized...",no
111659,"I think the quality of the Readers' Choice books are on a par with other EP series similarily priced. The Famous Editions and signed books do have a different feel, but I don't find the difference a concern. In general EP's quality has declined over the years. Long ago the books smelled and felt like leather. Today we get the smell and feel of a chemical coating, the Michaud Crusades excepted; however, I do detect a faint chemical odor with the LE Divine Comedy. In my opinion the finest quality leather-bound books recently produced in the US were by The Franklin Library -- not all of their series, but many of them. They used a variety of leathers which have a feel and smell I have never seen on any EP book. ",no

I've nearly finished all of Shakespeare's plays and would like to reread the entirety. Please correct me in my comments as I am happy to learn. Troilus and Cressida is a most interesting play in its sheer, overt cynicism about love and war. The polar opposite to ""As You Like It"" of young love, triumphant. It was written after Hamlet. In ""As You Like It"" its as if the bard wrote the play ""in love"" and T&C through the eyes of an old man who has seen much of the world, the betrayals of love, the hubris of war.

Simple directions for posting to the wiki can be found at the bottom of each month's wiki page.   ...logo by cyderry ------------------ For the month of March, Im going to challenge you to read a book that has the name of a city (or town) on page 17 of your chosen book! The name must be a real city on planet earth that you (or I) can link to a Wikipedia page. If you dont know how to do a link, simply place the city name in parentheses and someone else will add the link.  For a match, you *must* have a city name on page 17 of the book you are reading, but it does not need to be the same city as someone elses book since there are different editions of the same book. Alternatively, if there are many city names on page 17, choose the one you want. Its the book that has to match  not the city name. Why page 17? Because March 17th is St. Patricks Day! For more TIOLI fun, try to find the name of a city in Ireland. On a sadder note, I guess this challenge this would be impossible to do with e-readers since there are no page numbers in them. Sorry! Addendum (on 3/5/11): If you have a Nook with page numbers, you may use that page 17 as long as you keep the font size constant so as not to change the page numbering system. This may sound like a difficult challenge, but it really is not. Youd be surprised how many city names are on page 17 of books! You just have to look for them. : ) Please list your books as follows: 1. Strange Pilgrims (Geneva)  Gabriel Garcia Marquez - SqueakyChu Are you ready? Are you set?

Dragonsinger by Anne McCaffrey June July August September October November December END OF 2011 And here is my list of popularity based on each month. At the end of each month I'll list the best and worst books and at the end of the year, I'll announce my best and worst book of 2011. If there is no terribly bad books for that month, the bottom three will be the worst. For the regular 12 months, I'll list them from the best book of that month to the third best book of that month. The same with the worst book of that month. And at the end of 2011, I'll caculate the top 12 books. Now I suddenly decided that when rating the best and worst books, the actual ratings go out the window. Why? Because sometimes how you view a book changes as you change, and maybe a book wasn't as good as some, but it deserves much more praise than some. Does that make sense? As long as it makes sense to me, I guess that's all that matters, right? January 1. His Majesty's Dragon by Naomi Novik 2. Ptolemy's Gate by Jonathan Stoud 3. Jinx on the Divide by Elizabeth Kay 4.

She wrote fictional stores about young people caught up in various events and the one I remember the best was about a young man who was a Romanised Briton and the empire was breaking down and legions being recalled to Rome and he was in love with a young British girl.

Caution: What I've noticed here on LT and in my years of bookselling, is that when a similar question is posited to a reader of SF, they immediately start naming SF 'classics', or their own personal favorites, (i.e. ""oh, you must read The Lensman series!"")essentially what one wants another to likerather than what the other person might really like.

She went back to a relative's gloomy house a year or two later, and started remembering what had happened.

11349,"What tags do you use, that most people don't? I tag all my books with the year in which they were first published, which I think is unusual. This is because I think if enough people do this, then one could click on a year and see what was published in that year, which would be interesting. I use the tag ""sociodynamics"" to cover any book that tries to explain how society in general works, be it history, economics, psychology or whatever. This is different from ""social science"" because many social science books limit themselves to quite specific things that can't be generalised about, or only attempt to describe things, not to explain them. I also use ""cliodynamics"" for history books that concentrate on why things happened and attempt to draw generalisable conclusions, rather than just describing what happened. I use the tag ""past future"" for books that were written in the past about a future that is now the past. For example, 1984 was written in 1948, at which time 1984 was in the future. but in 2007 1984 is in the past and the world of the book is a ""future that didn't happen"". I also use ""Nazi victory"" for fiction set in worlds in which the Nazis won the war (there have been a surprisingly large number of books of this type published).  I use ""available online"" to indicate books that are available, for free, somewhere online. Not so much use to me, but if enough people use the tag it might become useful to browsers. And I use ""out of print"" to indicate books that have been out of print for a long time. I'm not sure why, but I'm sure it'll come in useful one day. I think I probably ""overtag"" my books. About two thirds of my tags I've only used once or twice. I tag nonfiction with anything I can think of, and with fiction I also like to tag the setting, the era in was written in and the country it originated from. Am I a bit obsessive? ",no

Simple directions for posting to the wiki can be found at the bottom of each month's wiki page.   ...logo by cyderry ------------------ For the month of April, I challenge you to Read a Book with Striking Cover Art. You may choose whichever book you like, but it should be one over which, when you first saw the book, you thought to yourself how special the cover art was. If one such book has already jumped to mind, thats the book to choose for this challenge. In addition, Im asking that each person who participates in this challenge PLEASE post a picture of your chosen book (unless someone else has already posted it) in the separate thread which is associated with this challenge. In a link from that thread, you will learn how to get the graphic image of your book cover to appear.  It would also be helpful to know who created the cover art. So often, the credit for cover art is hidden on an inconspicuous place in the book. Lets recognize and cheer for those who create striking cover art. Please include a few thoughts as to what made the cover art of your chosen book stand out for you. In summary, heres what to do: 1.	List your book on the wiki as usual. 2.	Post an image of your book cover on the separate thread. 3.	Name the person who created the cover art. 4.	Tell why you like the cover art. 5.	Start again with item #1 above. 6.	Have fun! Further clarification: In the event that you are matching a chosen book, do not post a second picture of the same book in the separate thread. You may, however, contribute your own comments about the books cover art there. Judging books by their covers may be wrong, but it's oh so much fun.

113809,"I know it's a novel, and I think I read it about ten to twelve years ago. It was a book about a white couple who decided to adopt a child, then ended up adopting a double-digit number of them over the course of the book with no thought to nationality or special needs.  I remember some specific scenes. One had the couple so poor that they were forced to eat a five-to-ten year-old decorative can of rattlesnake meat, opening it from the bottom so that they could wash it out and continue to display it. Also, there was a scene later in the book in which one of the couple's black daughters begged her parents to wash her skin until it was white like theirs. My mother or grandmother gave this to me, so I'm pretty sure it was intended for young adult or adult audiences. It had chapters, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't a children's book or teen fiction. The edition I read was paperback, with a tan cover. On the cover was artwork depicting several people from the shoulders up- can't remember how many.

The MC is a teenage girl, and there is a mysterious/dangerous young man that is trying to win her affections. I think he offers her a ring, but she's given/finds a different ring and wears that instead. I remember the stone in it was milky, and that she thinks, comparatively, that the ring she wears is ugly compared to the one he offers.

114038,"Hello everyone, I've been googling and searching and scratching my head over this one... I really hope someone knows the book! Setting: Post-apolcalyptic, I can't remember the event (possibly nuclear), but the society in the book is living in a self-sustained Dome and different classes / occupations (I think it was occupations rather than classes...) have to wear different coloured clothes. They are forbidden to go outside, only some people who have to do something just outside (can't remember what) do go out and when they do they wear protective contaminant suits and have to go through decontamination when they come back in. Plot: Somehow the girl protagonist ends up outside, and there is a small society living out there (very basic living though), some of whom have minor mutations like 6 toes on a foot. I think one of the characters was called Hana. The protagonist goes back into the dome, and is arrested, and there is a trial but for some reason I can't recall they end up deciding her punishment is to be exile, banishment to the outside, but they decided it partly because they knew she wanted to be there. Publishing: I read this in maybe 2002, give or take a year. I'm pretty sure the author was Australian. The cover of the edition I read had the Dome on it. I've been googling ""The Outlanders"" and ""The Outsiders"" because I keep thinking it was something like that, but I have not been able to find it so now I have no idea!

115817,"Out Came the Sun: A Day in Nursery Rhymes  398.8 Out 2007 By Heather Collins In extended picture book format, this book is a nursery rhyme anthology with a loose storyline. Carefully-selected nursery rhymes narrate the life in one day for a large family of stuffed animals living in a make-believe, nursery-world land. In choosing this title, I was looking for an informational book geared toward a young audience; this book lends itself well to reading aloud, given the rhythmic nature of nursery rhymes. It is not an information book in the typical sense, but could be considered a concept book in the sense that it introduces young children to nursery rhymes, which inherently introduce them to various every-day critters and objects (The cow jumped over the moon, and the dish ran away with the spoon). This particular anthology of classic nursery rhymes is very sweetly illustrated, where the illustrations support the loose story line and add to the rhymes presented. There is a very nice foreword by the author that explains the importance of early literacy and reading to your children. I recommend you check it out. (Its one I would consider for my own library of childrens books). Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice  921 Colvin, Claudette 2009 By Phillip Hoose I first heard about this book through a speaker at the Oregon Library Association Conference in April this year. It intrigued me as the story of a teen who refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus  all before Rosa Parks famous refusal. In this well-written book, Hoose uses first-hand accounts from interviews with Colvin (and others involved in her life and struggles) as the basis of the story. He supplements with articles and books from his research; all these items are acknowledged in the books bibliography. Using a blend of Colvins own words and Hooses research on her life, this book really brings a disturbing era in history to life in a very real way. Its incredibly readable and would likely appeal more to older readers since it is quite lengthy and in-depth. I would recommend this book strongly, for its quality and for the important history lesson it offers.  The Salem Witch Trials: An Interactive History Adventure  133.43 Doeden 2011 By Matt Doeden Another new take on the choose-your-own adventure novel, this book explores the infamous Salem witch trials in a way that allows the reader to make key decisions at pivotal moments, taking various paths through history. There are 3 main storylines or paths, with multiple choose-your-own decisions along each path. For instance, you can be an accuser, the accused, or the son of a woman accused of witchcraft. What I enjoyed most about this book was the way it brought this historical period to life; I was part of the history and could learn along the way both from the story and from the historical pictures and captions. A good pick, especially for kids who think history is far removed and boring  this book will plop them into the middle of an authentic historical story where they can learn and be entertained. This book contains an index, bibliography, suggested reading list (including websites), glossary of terms, and explanatory notes included at the end. ",no
115885,"I read a short story about 50-55 years ago (in what I believe to be a sixth or eighth grade reader or cultural studies book) about an Indian boy who was on a vision quest (or something of that nature) wherein he was out in the forest by himself in order to become a man, or to find himself or his future. Perhaps to return to his tribe when he discovered his path in life. At the end of his quest he would be renamed in accordance with what he discovered about himself or the world he encountered. He was told not to go into the forbidden area (all of the people in his tribe were so instructed) but when he was out in the forest alone, he believed a bird (perhaps an eagle) was the spirit he should follow and it led him into the forbidden area.  When he entered the forbidden area the description of the forbidden area in the story was of a great city with wide paved roads, tall buildings, strange objects (like modern day appliances?) etc., all of which had been damaged and abandoned hundreds or thousands of years before. As I recall, the description of this ghost city was similar to what someone may have described after a nuclear bomb went off, and I remember my teacher stating that the author had written this story prior to the world ever knowing what a nuclear bomb was or what a nuclear blast could do. I contacted my teacher, and many students in my class, many years ago but to no avail. No one but me seems to remember reading the story and no one recalls the name of the book or reader the story was in.  I don't know if this is the right group to be asking, but if someone could direct me to the right group or make a suggestion as to how I would go about finding out more about this story, I would be indebted to you.

For those following the challenge to read a non-fiction book if you usually read mostly fiction (or vice-versa), I thought it might be interesting to explore here our preferences for fiction or non-fiction, and for those of us who keep meaning to read more of one type of book, what is stopping us doing so? Is is because we have to read non-fiction for work, so this feels like too much hard work? How many of us actually do record our work- or study-related reading on LT, I wonder? I have a whole study full of theology books, some read but far too many of them unread, and nearly all of them uncatalogued, while the ones I did read were mostly from the libraries at college and no longer in my collection. I've also got a large number of books about medieval history and culture, as well as scholarly editions of medieval literature - many of these picked up second-hand while I was studying these things, but most of these have remained unread.

However, that admiration has waned somewhat over the decades, and I mainly want to find out if my perceptions underlying that change are mistaken.  My perception is that the Church was much more decentralized in the 1970s and before than it became after that time. The Mormons I knew during that period were quite free about talking about their heterodox doctrines that differed from other sorts of Christianity and seemed to feel free to pick and choose many of the doctrines of the day from the central Church. If I might use a distinction from Jewish debates over these topics, Mormonism use to be more of a civilization rather than a sect.  My perception is further that both those aspects of a typical Mormon are different today. Mormons today seem to want to emphasize their similarities to other sorts of Christianty and have an almost ""party line"" as to observance and what to say to Gentiles.  Am I right or just deluded?

Authors like Lyndon Hardy, Catherine Cooke, or Carole Nelson Douglas (before she found more long-lasting success with mysteries :) )... authors whose works aren't particularly mind-blowing and don't fit into any ""unsung classic"" category, but that would still be something worth picking up for a couple bucks at a used bookstore.

I'm not even sure whether I'm simply being dense here: processes have become so complicated in the guise of improvement (and buggy, judging by recent reports) that I rarely get myself into combining any more. Perhaps it is an unhappy symptom of the unfinished business of multiple authors and already a wellknown problem to all. I was visiting the page of this author: http://www.librarything.com/author/leyelcf Her name was wrong which I found was due to a misspelled canonical name. I removed the canonical name which caused the author name to revert to Margaret Grieve, who is a different person so I had to reinsert a correct canonical name. The reason for this is that A Modern Herbal, of which there are large numbers of copies on LT and whose primary author is Margaret Grieve, has Mrs Leyel (correctly) as an 'Other Author'. This caused Margaret Grieve to dominate over Mrs Leyel on Mrs Leyel's own page. Is this not nuts? v",no

They are old-fashioned police procedurals, but I still enjoy the series.  Margery Allingham and Dorothy L. Sayers have several books set in London. Death of a Ghost and Pearls Before Swine are some great ones by Allingham, and Murder Must Advertise is one of my favorite Sayers books. The Martha Grimes books are mainly set in London. Haven't read those in a while. The Bruce Alexander series that starts with (I think) Blind Justice is set in mostly in London during the 1700s.  And Victorian England has a subset all its own. Of course, there's the Sherlock Holmes books. But there's also the Anne Perry books and the cozy series by Emily Brightwell.  Agatha Christie also has some set in London, mainly featuring Poirot.

With my non-fiction I am very eclectic, although history and off course biology books are always in the mix. Fiction wise I am expanding my horizons, but my absolute favorite genre is and will remain mysteries  cozy mysteries and historical mysteries mostly, but this year Im slowly going towards the more gritty ones, although I do tend to stay away from the really gritty one (I leave those to my mother). Pure historical fiction is also something I enjoy, as well as thrillers, particularly those with a scientific focus.

What we know:  He is gaunt and sullen-looking. He is ugly with a squashed nose, a mouth too wide for his face and ears too big that stick out besides. He looks six but claims to be nine. He is short and skinny with huge ears, nose and mouth. He looks ten.  Olver is an orphan. He father was killed by the Shaido. His mother died of illness. Random theories surrounding Olver:  - He is Gaidal Cain - He is Mat reborn We know by now that Olver is not/or at least unlikely to be Gaidal Cain.  For a start his age is wrong, secondly I think Birgitte would recognise him, thirdly RJ has denied it.  Mat Cauthon reborn:  One of the arbest theories I have come across in recent times.  The crux of the theory is that due to Mat's ""death"" at the hands of Rhavin, Olver was born to replace him.  Olver is much to old for that anyway, but the author seems to think that Olver is a 'young Mat'.  This is true in part, but mostly due to Mat's influence.  Anyway: What are your theories on Olver?  Personally I still believe that he will play some part in beating the finns. I know Noal has volunteered to accompany Mat and Thom to the rescue, but I believe that Olver will be the 'third man' as per Moiraine's letter to Thom.  His obsession with Snakes and Foxes is to me a foreshadowing on the confrontation and rescue attempt that is to come.  is Olver important or is he just a random character?",no

According to the ""new topic pages"" thread (the last few posts, at least) http://www.librarything.com/topic/116769 , I'm not the only one disappointed by the lack of usefulness of the ""About"" touchstones.

Right now, the only way to access the ""About"" data is through the left-hand side ""Book discussions"", which gives the options of "" Your books"", ""Your authors"", ""Books by your authors"" and ""Your series"". We have no option of seeing any ""About"" conversations for a specific book. I, for one, do not find it convenient to look through that list to try to find the book I'm looking for.

The general idea was to collect at least one book published from 1947 until now. The guidelines established were as follows: 1. The work must be an original edition (not a reprint) for the year in question. 2. Works originally in English would have priority. However, translations from Spanish will always be considered. 3. Fiction, theatre, poetry, memoirs and essays that contribute to a deeper understanding of English cultural heritage and values (in the broadest sense) would have priority over other works. 4. These criteria do not apply to the very first book published by the Folio Society (a translation from Russian). 5. A subcollection would be established for Shakespeare's 37 plays (featuring the seven quill design on the cover). In this case reprints of editions would be acceptable.

121015,"I'm always being horrified by something lately in the depiction of women in films and literature... Well, I got round to seeing that silly film 'Troy' a few weeks ago, hoping to have a good laugh as I'd heard it was so bad. I was disturbed by the treatment of women in it, what with the nasty way that their Achilles shoves away one of the women he's in a threesome with (of course!)at the beginning (I suppose they were meant to be former war prizes).Then the creepy scene where he is stripping off to wash and strutting about supposedly naked with the audience obviously being titilated by the prospect of his raping the captive Briseis, who is tied to a pole (Fredian, or what?!)  Yes, I know men weren't too troubled about women and consentual sex in the Bronze Age, and the ancient heroes were all rapists to a man, but I thought this film was encouraging a modern audience to gloat over women being victims.  The film makers tried to make it seem as if the film was anti-rape by having him rescue her from Agamemnon's troops.  She goes on to develop a fine case of Stockholm Syndrome, which I found really creepy.  What really worried me was that on the internet, so many women thought their eventual relationship was 'romantic', wrote a lot of 'fanfiction' about it, etc, for all he is violent to her when she tries to stop him killing one of his lieutenants. You see he gives her some jewellery and comes running after her in h is leather mini skirt to Troy at the end, and that makes it all right, it seems.  I counted about twelve women on the web who objected to it and/or thought the relationship abusive. Many said, 'Oh, lucky thing...etc etc'. Steam came from my ears and I wrote an article for the 'fword' on line feminist magazine (silly me, forgotten url bt You can get it with key words 'Troy Briseis Stockholm syndrome' if anyone cares to have a look) under my pen name LucindaE.  I am still dismayed that women are so indifferent to the portayal of potential rape as an erotic tableau, or couldn't see it, or something, or even thought the character 'feisty'. About as feisty as a Georgette Heyer heroine, that is, putting up token resistance before succumbing to the irresistable male.  Ironically,Brad Pitt came to fame in 'Thelma and Louise' about twenty years ago, which was a sympathetic portrayal of women violently resisting rape, though no doubt as a man he doesn't think much about these things and apparently asked to be filmed naked in the famous scene.  No doubt Wolfgang Petersen would claim his film is anti rape and feminist for he makes his character kill off Agamemnon in the end, though tamed by her former captor after a totally unconvincing knife threat to him.

121685,"Just got the FS newsletter emailed to me. There will be 26 titles published between August and January. Here are the details, straight from the news letter: The new publishing year is just around the corner Twenty-six titles to be published between August and January The excitement is building at Folio as we get set for the launch of the new publishing year ... our 65th! Twenty-six titles are to be published, and all these new books will be delivered by January 2012 . Heres a brief preview. As announced in the previous issue of the Folio Newsletter, the winner of the inaugural Folio Society / House of Illustration Award was Matthew Richardson for his work on Albert Camuss The Outsider, one of the first nine titles to be delivered. It is joined by Jack Londons classic The Call of the Wild, a definite contender for bestseller. Few adventure writers can equal Londons pace and verve, and with its evocation of the American wilderness - enhanced in our edition through Abigail Rorers dramatic illustrations - it speaks as powerfully today as when it was first published over 100 years ago. Following the successful Folio editions of Bedes History of the English Church and People and The History of the Kings of Britain by Geoffrey of Monmouth, we are now publishing what is arguably the seminal text of early Christianity - The History of the Church - by the 4th century Roman historian Eusebius. Dr Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, has written a preface for our edition. Another work that had a profound historical influence is Holinsheds Chronicles - a key Elizabethan document which inspired many of Shakespeares plays. We are also publishing In Cold Blood, Truman Capotes classic account of the brutal murder of a farming family in 1959 - a book which effectively spawned the true crime genre. In a wholly different vein, we are delighted to present H. E. Batess immortal Larkin clan in a fabulously illustrated new edition of The Darling Buds of May. Early Christian martyrs; true crime in the American midwest; or the Larkins perfick lives - the forthcoming Folio list has something for everyone.

Part 1 was here: http://www.librarything.com/topic/97388 This year, I decided to simply give my categories names and NOT define them, and be free to use any books that can in any way fit the category name. I did a pretty good job of staying with my categories in 2010, but I was constantly tweaking the ""definition"" of what was included in several of them. I also allowed more space for reading mysteries this year, and especially series -- trying new ones that have been recommended, and catching up with the next installment of old favorites. (That's the point of the ""leadoff"" and ""on-deck"" categories.)  In fact, in general, I'm just trying to allow more space for reading what I want to read. These are the category names I've chosen. I reserve the right to move books around from one category to another later in the year to balance things out if books can fit in more than one category.  1. Pregame 2. Play Ball! 3. Leadoff 4. On-deck 5. Phantom players 6. All-Stars, MVP's, & Other Awards 7. Foul Play Territory 8. Fireballers, Rainouts, Steals, & Errors! 9. Away Game Travel Day (Cars, trains, boats & planes, etc.) 10.

I already have books in mind that fit, one way or another, as I view the categories. And the ""utility players"" category is for the books that don't fit into the regular lineup! My original plan was to do 7 books in each of these 11 categories -- a 7-11 challenge -- for a total of 77 books.

123690,"On the work combine/separate page, for example http://www.librarything.com/combine.php?work=91673 I've noticed, but find it difficult to nail down, that sometimes an edition in a work's list will show the wrong author. In the example page above, the first edition listed under Ascending : A Novel by Blaine M. Yorgason is ""Ascending : A Novel by James Alan Gardner (ISBN 0964996820)"". Note that the author is incorrect. If you go to the work's editions page (http://www.librarything.com/work/750365/editions) it shows one edition without an author, and none with James Alan Gardner. If you separate that edition from the work* it does not actually have James Alan Gardner listed as the author. This is very confusing, and of course also just wrong, and often leads me to unnecessary separations and recombinations. I think, but I'm not sure, and don't want to mess around and possibly break the scenario, that the book doesn't actually have an author listed, and on the combine/separate page it picks up the author from the previous work. * Why? I work on the assumption that if the user added the wrong book, they're more likely to edit the author than the ISBN, and so I believe the Title and Author more than I believe the ISBN.",no

At this point I'm unsure how I sit myself. I understand that language evolves and that it could be futile to attempt to alter in some way this natural process, but on the other hand there does seem to be some necessary firm logical 'rules' that should not be violated: word order for instance.

124472,"Continued from http://www.librarything.com/topic/117237#    The year is almost over. Hanukkah starts tomorrow, which is also the Solstice ~ the shortest day of the year, and a few days after that is Christmas, followed closely by New Year's Day. I am both happy and sad to see 2011 go. I read some great books so far. Also some not so great. Still, pretty much anything is better than no books at all! October already! It's hard to let summer go, and I can't believe it's almost Christmas. (Yes, I know Halloween and Thanksgiving come first, but you know all you have to do is blink twice and it will be Christmas I have no particular reading goals for this quarter,.) I finished 75 books plus 53 so far. I only hope I can continue my streak of reading really good, some even great, books, like these 5-star gems from the past 12 months: Maus II: And Here My Troubles Began by Art Spiegelman (graphic) The Girl Who Played With Fire by Stieg Larsson (thriller) The Fifth Witness by Michael Connelly (courtroom mystery) Leviathan by Scott Westerfeld (steampunk) The Help by Kathryn Stockett (historical, sort of) The Cabinet of Curiosities by Preston and Child (thriller) Still Life With Crows by Preston and Child (thriller) Watership Down (reread as an audiobook) by Richard Adams (classic) Essential Dykes to Watch Out For by Alison Bechdel (graphic) Dog On It by Spencer Quinn (humorous mystery) Doc by Mary Doria Russell (historical fiction) Graceling by Kristin Cashore (fantasy) Plus there were over two dozen 4.5 stars and dozens more with 4 stars. A quick note to explain a bit about how I rate the books I read. First, it has to be well written, grammatically and stylistically, otherwise I'm likely to be thrown out of the story, no matter how good the tale. Then it has to hold my interest, whether by well-shaped multi dimensional characters or by a well-told story (preferably both). I also have to engage with at least one of the characters, care what happens to them, or no matter how well written otherwise I'll probably not finish it. I prefer plots that are not too far-fetched for the genre (scifi and fantasy obviously entail fantastical happenings, but it has to make sense and be possible within the framework of the world in which it is told; I don't like plot devices that are just not probable, just to heighten the tension or provide a vehicle for the protagonist to get out of trouble). It doesn't have to be a literary masterpiece, as long as it holds my interest. Unforced humor is always welcome. If I dislike it, for one reason or another, or it bores me, I will not finish it, which is why you won't see too many (if any) ratings below 3 stars. Books I've read so far this year: Jan.  1.

The main characters leave Earth in a spaceship to find a new home, for reasons that escape me now. They are told that they can only bring one book each, and hence have to read it slowly, reading every sentence twice. The narrator, a small child, notes that the computers of more advanced spacecraft could hold many hundreds of books, but their spaceship is old, and does not have this capacity. When they finally reach the planet, they find it is inhabited by man-size butterfly-like aliens, that they eventually befriend. I seem to recall that the aliens shed their skin, and the Earth colonists were able to use these to make clothes and blankets.

It is about a young woman, who has yet to be named (?), that grew up in upstate New York. Both of her parents have died and she is attending college on scholarship. She was utterly devoted to intellectual activities her first year of school - she was the person who read and reread each assignment and all of the footnotes. Later, a young, pretty woman in her dorm befriended her and encouraged her to rush her sorority. Without thinking about what that would mean for her financially, she agreed to do so and got swept up in all of the attention she was getting, never quite understanding their motivations. Now she is working lots of hours to help with money and is missing mixers and meetings for which she gets fined. She can't keep up. She's eating out of dumpsters and losing things and is unable to keep up with her schoolwork, which is so important to her. Only 25% of the way through, she is already circling in madness.

125347,When I was in London this past spring I saw a book at Liberty's that had some kind of tweedy-houndstoothy-herringbony-type cover and was about English country life or hunting or something in that general area. It had sort of a humorous slant on the whole thing but wasn't necessarily a humor book.

126152,"When conversations have come up here about the effect of secularism on ethics has come up, it usually involved Hitler, Stalin Pol Pot, or someone or culture that has done horrible things.  But I was thinking, influenced a bit by OWS, Marketplace, and recent discussions on religion and ethics. Using the Bad Guys as examples of where godlessness leads is just bad form, and can be equaled or better by what happens when the bad guys wear red robes or white headbands.  HOWEVER, were I too look at a working example of secular ethics in action, I think it would be the business community. As a person of faith, one of my prime complaints over the years was how little a person's faith commitments played over in their work life.  For example, in one church I attended, it was rare, but not unusual for someone to stand up and give their testimony (Conversion story). One guy did, and among the sins he mentioned was that he ripped off the customers who bought from his motorcycle parts shop. He vowed he would make good on it. Several people came up to him and told him he was out of line to talk about business at church. Whenever sound business practices come up against Scripture, Sound Business Practices win.  And that is in the Christian community.  It seems, and I am willing to be proven wrong, that the best indicator how how secularism works in practice, is the business community. Not Stalin, not Walden Two, but IBM, Apple, AIG, Enron, Sony, etc.  What thinks ye, O enlightened ones?",no
126153,"Since the last one was starting to get a little long, I figured I'd start up a new thread to take me through the last two months of the year. To kick things off, here's an obscure little fantasy novel I'm sure none of you have ever heard of: 133. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling  Having started re-reading this series, I figured I might as well keep going, even if it is taking me a while. I definitely did find this one a bit more engaging than book one, although, even in retrospect, I don't exactly see it brimming over with mega-hit potential. Personally, I'm largely inclined to credit the series' success more to luck and chaos theory than to any special brilliance on J.K. Rowling's part. But it is an amusingly written story, and the plot is entertaining enough, even if it does feature a bit too much of characters neglecting to share information (a personal pet peeve of mine) and end with something of a deus ex machina. Rowling is clearly working on fleshing out her world and its backstory a little more at this point, which is nice, except that the more world-building she does, the more inclined I am to nitpick at it. (Like, how believable is it that the magical world is such a well-kept secret from us Muggles when there's so much intermarriage, and Muggle-born children regularly enter wizard society? Does Hogwarts have any safety standards at all? And why are the rules of Quidditch so stupid?) Which makes re-reading this a weirdly conflicted experience for me, because Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the funny, fluffy little kids' book, really doesn't deserve that kind of scrutiny, but Harry Potter, the worldwide pop culture phenomenon and defining story of a generation, is positively asking for it. Also, I am still weirdly disappointed that Professor Snape did not miraculously become the main character while I wasn't looking. In fact, my biggest reaction to reading this again now is to wonder what the heck the adults were up to through this whole thing. Surely the answer isn't ""basically nothing?"" I mean, Rowling obviously doesn't want us to think they're stupid, right? Rating: 3.5/5. Although I can't decide whether that's unfairly low or not. It's become utterly impossible to judge these books on their own merits, I'm afraid.",no

Not positive on the colors, mind you; but the fact that stuck in my head was each side only used that color. As I recall...or think I recall...the hero stumbles over the heroine, who is a member of an advanced society (I can't recall if she was an alien or time traveler), and of course gets drawn into the struggle.

But the real word for a group of witches is 'an argument'."" p122 ""That was the thing about witches. They were, according to Granny Weatherwax, 'people what looks up'. She didn't explain. She seldom explained. She didn't mean people who looked at the sky; everyone did that. She probably meant that they looked up above the everyday chores and wondered, What's all this about? How does it work? And possibly even: Is there anything worn under the kilt? Perhaps that was why odd, in a witch, was normal..."" p153 ""Witches aren't superstitious. We're what people are superstitious of."" p178 ""Anyone could be a witch at midnight, she'd thought, but you'd have to be really good to be a witch by noonlight. Good at being a witch anyway..."" p191 ""Hexperiment: to use magic just to see what happens."" p223 ""People wanted the world to be a story, because stories had to sound right and they had to make sense. people wanted the world to make sense."" p268 ""Iron enough to make a nail Lime enough to paint a wall Water enough to drown a dog Sulphur enough to stop the fleas Potash enough to wash a shirt Gold enough to buy a bean Silver enough to coat a pin Lead enough to ballast a bird Phosfor enough to light the town Poison enough to kill a cow"" p325 ""Strength enough to build a home, Time enough to hold a child, Love enough to break a heart."" p382 ""When the noise had died down a bit the drummer beat a few times and the accordianist played a long drawn-out cord, the legal signal that Morris Dance is about to begin, and people who hang around after this have only got themselves to blame.

128238,"So far three of the five reviews for November book Whither Thou Goest, I Will Go are saying that they cannot access the book without downloading special software. I was able to read it without doing this, once I figured out how. The publisher has signed each of us reviewers up to a site called Logos (which was a bit annoying, since they didn't ask permission first). 1) Find the email from Logos.com, click on the link to reset your password. 2) Use this new password along with the email address you use at LibraryThing to log into their sister site www.biblia.com 3) Ignore the Bible if it is opened automatically, go to the top right hand corner of the screen and click on the book icon (Library). 4) Find Whither Thou Goest, I Will Go in the list of books that are available to you and click on it. 5) You may find that it is opened in parallel to the Bible, rather than by itself. If so, you can click on the image of the book cover just to the left of the name of the book and select ""Show Reading View (fullscreen)"" or ""Stretch Across Both Columns"". 6) You can now read this in your browser in a fairly straight-forward html format. I didn't download the Vyrso app, so I can't comment on what it's like to use. The (perfectly friendly) email I got with the instructions also asked me to post my review on Amazon and Good Reads, which I have not done, since I don't think I am obliged to as part of the Early Reviewer programme. For what it's worth I do vastly prefer publishers who just let you download a DRM free ebook in a choice of formats, and don't make you jump through any hoops. It can't be to the author's advantage for the publisher to annoy the reviewers! (Yes I know I'm getting to read a book for free, but lots of grumpy reviews are bad from their point of view too.)",no

128927,"It seems that the literary community of Club Read is suffering from piles. TBR piles, that is. To determine the extent of the problem, answer the following questions: Looking back at the books you read in 2011, what percentage of them had been in your home for at least 6 months before you read it? Of this percentage, how many did you buy NEW? *If your percentage of TBR reading is 50 or more, consider yourself in cured of ""the piles""  *If your percentage of TBR reading is 25 - 50, you may need therapy and a support group, OR surgery to remove the guilty conscience.  *If your percentage of TBR reading is less than 25, than you indeed have a problem and you suffer from a severe cases of the piles. There are a few options. 1. Read more. Buy less. The numbers should work out, just like dieting. 2. Call yourself a collector and you can be cured immediately (and never have to read another book!). 3. Set a goal to read a larger percentage of TBRs. Make a list. If nothing else it will impress people and make you feel better. 4. Do nothing, change your attitude.  Subtract your percentage of 2011 TBR reading from 100, that will be your ""Pile points"". So, if 75% of your reading was from your TBR pile, as defined above, subtracted from 100, would give yourself 25 pile points. Guilt. If a majority of your TBRs were bought new. Give yourself 50 guilt points. If most were bought for a pittance at a library sale, give yourself only 30 guilt points. If it was a gift, you deserve only 10 guilt points.  Geography. If you can still walk around your home with ease, give yourself 10 Geography points. If you must remove piles of books from the dining room table or from chairs & other furniture in order to accommodate visitors, give yourself 20 Geography points. If walking through your house is hazardous due to piles of unread books, give yourself 30 Geography points. Now add your Geography and Guilt points to your Pile Points. How sick are you? Range from a total of 20 (bravo! you really don't have a problem, so what are you hanging around here for?) to a dismal 180 (sick! sick! sick! go see Dr. kidzdoc, Dr. Nickelini or Dr. Cait86, who have vowed to help their fellow sufferers OR take the attitude surgery:-)",no

129251,"Welcome to my 2012 thread. This is my second year in the 75-ers. Looking back on my 2010 thread from the 50-ers, and particularly my favourites from that year, I'm sad to say that 2011 didn't match it. There were many books fighting for top place in 2010, but fewer that really grabbed me in 2011. However, my top ten were: Fiction Cutting for Stone by Abraham Verghese Barchester Towers by Anthony Trollope The Rules of Gentility by Janet Mullany Sister by Rosamund Lupton The Gallows Curse by Karen Maitland Non-fiction West End Girls by Barbara Tate The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot White Gold by Giles Milton Nathaniel's Nutmeg by Giles Milton Death and the Virgin by Chris Skidmore   All of these were excellent reads, but they fell quite easily into the top ten. I didn't have lots of others competing for places.  I particularly liked how different the fiction books were - from the Trollope to the delicious Rules of Gentility - a Regency romance romp like nothing I've read before, and which still makes me giggle when I think about it. A lot of last year's books were romances, and this year I would like to read fewer romances and try some different types of books instead. As it's the Dickens bicentenary in 2012, there is a lot going on here in the UK in terms of articles and events, so I'm aiming for one Dickens novel a month, and to go to some Dickens events, or at the very least the exhibition at the Museum of London. I'm pretty poorly read when it comes to the classics, so I'm going to make an effort with at least one author.  I'm also going to try and Stop Buying Stuff, particularly for the Kindle. I don't have that many hard copy books, but that one-click download button is a real temptation. I'm aiming to finish what I already have, and then think about some new things.

In response, I made this list, letting loose my most pretentious ambitions. This is just a rough outline, of course, leaving me with some room to maneuver. Poetry: Paradise Lost, along with Milton's other English-language poetry. A Coney Island of the Mind as counterpoint. Drama:  Having immersed myself in 20th century playwrights this past year, I need to check out the old guys. Hamlet and Marlowe, for a start. Novels: The Portrait of a Lady. The Alexandria Quartet. The Rainbow. Therese Raquin. Candide. Queer and Junky. Cryptonomicon (if I can possibly make the time).  Something by Eco, Camus, Duras, Hesse, Mahfouz.... Stories: Kleist and Hoffmann. Nonfiction: Axel's Castle. The Birth of Tragedy. Thoreau and Emerson. De Profundis. The Decline of the West. Eiffel and the Belle Epoque backed with The Empire State Building and New York City (sometimes I like a gimmick). Gods, Graves and Scholars: The Story of Archeology. Antiquity: Greco-Roman would be Sophocles or Sappho, Medieval would be The Nibelungenlied or Abelard and Heloise. ______ So, is anyone else planning some ambitious/pretentious reading in the year upcoming?

130096,"To those of you who gave this book simply mediocre marks; WHA???????????????????????????????????????????? I loved it. Read it in 2 sittings. One in bed last night and then this afternoon.  Larry's Party is about Larry. Larry at 30, Larry's Love, Larry's Folks, Larry's Work, Larry's Words, Larry's Friends, Larry's Penis, Larry Inc, Larry So Far, Larry's Kid, Larry's Search for the Wonderful and the Good, 1992, Larry's Threads, 1993-4, Men Called Larry, Larry's Living Tissues, 1996, and lastly Larry's Party. So it is all about Larry and the different highlights and lowlights of Larry's life. I found it fascinating reading. I think anyone who loves words would. Larry is just a guy; basically this book could be about any man out there. Larry becomes fascinated with mazes and it changes his life. Every major point in Larry's life changes it. The women in Larry's life are fascinatingly different and when you put them together, Larry's life gets more interesting momentarily. I don't know how I have missed Carol Shields but know I will read more books by her. I really loved Larry's Party and it will probably be on my Orange January list again next year. I highly recommend this one and rated it 4 1/2 stars.",no
130237,"Hi! I'm Kelly. This will be my 4th year in the 75 Group. This year I expect to read more of the usual - fantasy, YA, poetry and nonfiction- plus more literary fiction and classics. Most of my planned nonfiction reading is food related. I'm participating in the 12 in 12 challenge and the TIOLI food challenge in that group. (Cook 1 recipe a month from your neglected cookbooks)  It took me awhile to decide if I wanted to have a thread in this years group. Initially I just planned to follow the threads I normally follow and participate in TIOLI challenges when I could make my books fit. A few months ago I found out that I'm having ""mini strokes"". I thought I was having frequent, short migraines. So, I will be spending a lot of time making lifestyle changes. I'm going to be modifying my already vegetarian diet to contain less fat. (Good-bye cheese. Or, at least, most cheeses) I'm going to be spending more time exercising and probably less time reading (what? It could happen) My sister asked me to run a full marathon with her in 2013. I agreed, so, will need to start training for that. I'm hoping the RA in my knees can handle running.   I'm looking forward to checking out the threads and adding many books to my wish list.  Happy reading!!  ",no

I am trying to find a balance between LT and non-LT related things, so I am thinking that game playing is a place to start. I also have a myriad of home projects that need to be completed.

I'm an atheist for sure (you may have noticed) and when I look at humanist websites and go through their checklist of humanist 'symptoms' I see myself there pretty much 100% but I've never felt the need to join a group that defines its members by their lack of belief in a god, any more than I would join a group of people all of whom don't believe in the Yeti. So I'm hoping there is a humanist out there who can tell me what I'm missing and what good reasons I - or anyone else - might have for wanting to define themselves this way.

This year started well though the holidays allowed me to complete two book I had had on the go at the end of 2011 but could not finish, and I also managed another one before getting back to work. I read first a book about a young lawyer who became Crown Council for Sarawak - after it had been handed over to the British by last Rajah and just before independence. A really interesting read made all the more interesting as I was in Kuching last year. A small pretty place that I enjoyed a lot. Its not the best written book in the world - but an enjoyable read. Next I finished Pride and Prejudice - again. I have read it I have no idea how many times but I do enjoy it very much every time I read it. Jane Eyre, I would say is my actual favourite book - but Pride and Prejudice is well up among my favourites. I will start Emma I think and keep it going this year as well. Would like to try to read all the Austen books over the next few years. Lastly, I read In the Wet by Neville Shute as I was in north Queensland for hols and it seemed a good choice. I enjoyed it as always - a consumate story teller - but I would put it lower than down on the list his books that I like: 1.

I can't imagine doing what some of these people have done, but I also can't imagine living in the circumstances they face every day of their sometimes-too-short lives. As I said in my review, had this book been a novel, I wouldn't have liked it very much because the characters are, for the most part, not very likeable. But these are real people, people the author came to know, and their stories deserve to be heard. My review and several others are on the book's LT page.

131064,"In the 4th century C.E., such important synods as the Synod of Hippo and the Council of Carthage put together a Bible canon equivalent to that found in Roman Catholic bibles today. While this list isn't technically ""official"" since these synods occurred prior to the ecumenical councils (since Christianity was still outlawed in the 4th century), this canon, the one found in the Vulgate (c. 400 C.E.), was standard in the Western Church (Orthodox bibles have even more books than RCC ones!) up until the Protestant Reformation. While some of the deuterocanonical books--those found in RCC bibles but not Protestant ones--were disputed due to their pseudepigraphal nature, the same is true of many of the NT books. 1 and 2 Peter were almost certainly not written by St. Peter, several Pauline letters were probably not written by St. Paul, and the authorship of the Epistle of James and the Johannine corpus are hotly contested even to this day. As my NAB puts it, ""With the exception of 1 Peter and 1 John, the ancient church showed reluctance to include the catholic letters in the New Testament canon. The reason for this was widespread doubt whether they had actually been written by the apostolic figures to whom they are attributed. The early Christians saw the New Testament as the depository of apostolic faith; therefore, they wished to include only the testimony of apostles. Today we distinguish more clearly between the authorship of a work and its canonicity: even though written by other, later witnesses than those whose names they bear, these writings nevertheless testify to the apostolic faith and constitute canonical scripture. By the late fourth or early fifth centuries, most objections had been overcome in both the Greek and Latin churches (though not in the Syriac), and all seven of the catholic letters have since been acknowledged as canonical.""

14009,"""The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing, Traitor to the Nation, Volume I, The Pox Party"" by M.T. Anderson  compared with Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen  with assistance from Jane Austen by Carol Shields Time Period Both of these books are set in approximately the same time period: Northanger Abbey is set in rural and small-town (Bath) England in the late 1790s; Octavian Nothing is set in rural and small-town (Boston) North America from 1760 to 1775.  Genre Both are coming-of-age sagas; however, whereas Northanger Abbey is light-hearted, silly, and humorous; Octavian Nothing is gothic, horrifying, and abundantly rich with weighty subtexts. Northanger Abbey is a coming-of-age saga told in the usual fashion: an emotional, immature youth has experiences over the course of the novel which help the child to develop, by the end of the novel, into a mature, appropriately rational adult. Octavian Nothing is a most unusual, backwards coming-of-age saga: a child raised as a scientific experiment by purely rational philosophers and scientists has experiences over the course of the novel which help the child to develop, by the end of the novel, into a mature, appropriately emotional adult.  Language Both novels are written in exquisite 18th century language: Northanger Abbey, because it was the language of the day, and Austen one of its preeminent masters; and Octavian Nothing, because the author chose to narrate this novel completely from period documents. The novel is told entirely through fictional primary resourcesOctavians own manuscript testimony, newspaper clippings, letters, scientific papers, and the like.  Personally, I was positively dazzled by the authenticity of the period language. How Anderson was able to accomplish this feat, and maintain it through countless different narrative voices is astoundingin my opinion, an unparalleled modern literary tour de force. In an interview with the author on the publishers website, Anderson admits: This book was difficult to write, technically. Every time I started a stint of work on it, it took me days to get back into the language. Sometimes I felt exhausted. Ive had to keep my reading diet incredibly pure over the last four yearsthe time it took me to write the novelconfining myself usually to books from or about the eighteenth century or things that would have been read then (such as Livy or Ovid).  Subthemes Northanger Abbey is the first novel that Jane Austen wrote. It is considered to be her most light-hearted, often downright burlesque. Austens novels are never weighted down by historical, political, or scientific subthemes. Major events and issues of the day appear in her novels only indirectly through implication (Jane Austen by Carol Shields p. 2-3). Jane Austen is often criticized by scholars as a countrified person in intellectual drag, imprervious to the noises of the historical universe in which she was placed (Jane Austen by Carol Shields p. 3). This is a point which Shields disputes. In 1996, Shields and her daughter, Anne, presented a joint paper at the Jane Austen Society of North America called The Politics of a Glance. The Paper reinterpreted Austens novels as wide-ranging glancesacross the material of the world she inhabited, and that material includes an implied commentary of the political, economic, and social forces of her day. These glances, like ubiquitous sunlight, sweep and suggest, excoriate and questionBy indirection, by assumption, by reading what is implicit, we can find behind Austens novels a steady, intelligent witness to a world that was rapidly reinventing itself. Every Austen conversation, every chance encounter on a muddy road, every evening of cards before the fire, every bold, disruptive militiaman is backed by historical implications (Jane Austen by Carol Shields p. 3-4). On the other hand, Octavian Nothing is a novel composed almost entirely of direct, in-your-face weighty subthemes. Well-known events in the American Revolution form the historical framework and provide the story with many of its most thought-provoking themes. The book deals with an extremely wide complexity of controversial issues, including: racism; slavery; hypocrisy; the ethics of scientific inquiry funded by commercial interests; the importance of virtue; the nature of altruism; the meaning of freedom; the meaning of being human; the ethics of human and animal experimentation; the ethics of ends justifying means; whether civilization is predicated upon commerce; the importance of forgivenessto name but a few. Reading Northanger Abbey for the first time a few weeks ago provided me an absolutely lovely day of literary pleasure; however, it is unlikely that I will read the book again in my lifetime. On the other hand, Octavian Nothing gets better with every rereading. It was one of those rare books that, upon finishing for the first time, I turned around immediately and reread the novel for the second time. The second reading took longer than the first because I found myself pausing repeatedly either to savor the beauty of the language or to ponder universal questions of philosophy, psychology, science, and history that pop up everywhere throughout the telling. It is highly likely that I will reread this book againin fact, I am already doing so. I originally read a library copy, but I subsequently bought an audio CD version and uploaded it into my iPod so I can listen to it while I walk and garden. I love listening to the exquisite prose! Importance of Books: A Significant Subtheme One important subtheme that these two works have in common is worth covering in depth, namely: the importance of increasing our experience of the world through books. Northanger Abbey is famous for Jane Austens personal spirited defense of the novel as a literary form. Early in the book, she cuts away from the development of the story to a rare first person singular I and mocks those who say pretentiously, I am no novel readerI seldom look into novels. In novels, Austen argues, the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language. This defense appears again at the end of the novel. The silly young lady we met at the beginning of the book with her ridiculously overblown imagination and love of gothic novels, is gone. We come to understand that Catherine actually benefits in her understanding of the world by having had the experience of reading. Jane Austen as much as taunts: See, even the reading of bad gothic literature is better than no literary experience at all in helping a simple country girl to expand her awareness of the real world outside her direct experience.  So, Catherine Moreland is helped on her way toward adulthood partially through the reading of trashy gothic novels; they expose her to possibilities of human nature, that she may not otherwise have encountered in her sheltered experience. It is through this odd, yet thoroughly brilliant manner, that Austen chooses to defend the novel both in the beginning and in the end.  Octavian Nothing concerns the life of the young slave, Octavian, from his earliest memories until the age of 16. For the first half of his life, the child does not realize that he is the object of a scientific experiment to determine whether homo africanus is a separate species from homo europaeus. The child is dressed in fine silks and given a comprehensive and exhaustive classical literary and musical education. He is told that he is an African prince and his mother an African princess. He is raised in virtual isolation by a household of scientists, philosophers, artists, and merchant investors calling themselves The Novanglian College of Lucidity. These men make sure that the child is kept at great emotional distance from his mother. Octavian is given every luxury, except the luxury to behave like a normal human child.  Despite the fact that Octavian is raised as an experiment by rational, and sometimes monstrously nonempathetic scientists, we see him mature into a virtuous, empathetic, whole human being. The transformation is slow and gut-wrenching. Three men unknowingly play significant roles as mentors: the philosopher Dr. Trefusis, the slave Bono, and the soldier Evidence Goring. But there is a one very significant additional source providing him with the raw building blocks necessary to reinvent himself as a fully realized emotional human being, namely the wealth of pseudo-life experience provided to him by his extraordinary classical literature and music education. In great part, this is the story of a child saved by his exposure to Ovid, Homer, Socrates, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Pope, Mozart, Handel, Corelli, and the like. Popular vs. Classics: The Test of Time Northanger Abbey is, inarguably, a literary classic that continues to withstand the test of time. Jane Austens legacy is not a piece of reportage from the society of a particular past, but a wise and compelling exploration of human nature. Her men and women speak their needs and define the barriers that separate them from peace and satisfaction. They are as alive today in their longings as they were, two hundred years ago, when she first gave them breath (Jane Austen by Carol Shields p. 182).  Octavian Nothing is, perhaps, a new classic in development. As we read his manuscript testimony in his own florid, literary, 18th-century words, we see Octavian come to life before us, as real a person as if Anderson had brought him to us through some magical time-machine. Octavian Nothing reads like a classic because of its exquisitely loving and authentic 18th-century prose. But only its popularity over time will tell if it ever advances to the full weight of a classic.  Octavian Nothing won the 2006 National Book Award for young adult fiction. But, here I have a very serious bone to pick with the author, editors, and publisher of this extraordinary work: Octavian Nothing is no more a young-adult book than Billy Budd or Daisy Miller! Naturally, it can be read and appreciated by mature high school students, but there is a much larger market of adults who might overlook this title because is being marketed too narrowly. The wide majority of adult reviewers highly praise this book. Ironically, it has proved somewhat unpopular among its targeted young adult audience. Many young readers appear either to miss or show disinterest in the novels many deep thought-provoking subthemes. For young readers, the book moves too slowly, and they are often challenged beyond their ability to understand the rich, lovingly recreated 18th-century language.  PS For no other reason, except happenstance, I read the three books discussed or quoted in this comparison review in the following order over the course of two weeks: 1) Carol Shields Jane Austen, 2) Jane Austens Northanger Abbey, and 3) M. T. Andersons Octavian Nothing. I would never have known about Octavian Nothing if it had not been for a favorite, book-loving friend of mine with a highly intelligent high school daughter. Both she and her daughter loved this book so much that after hearing about it from them, I knew I had to read it.

Since then I've learned a lot more about making charts and interpreting them. However, in 2002 I became a Christian and stopped all activity or reading in astrology. Now I'm wondering if the two really are incompatible, and researching what place, if any, an interest in astrology has for someone who believes that God is sovereign. I have a six month old daughter, and while I've resisted really looking at her chart, I did make a graphical representation for her scrapbook. You can see that here: Flickr link. So please, tell me about yourselves. And let's talk about books!",no

17195,"This horror story was in the New York Times  As U.S. Rebuilds, Iraq Wont Act on Finished Work    By JAMES GLANZ Published: July 28, 2007 Iraqs national government is refusing to take possession of thousands of American-financed reconstruction projects, forcing the United States either to hand them over to local Iraqis, who often lack the proper training and resources to keep the projects running, or commit new money to an effort that has already consumed billions of taxpayer dollars. The Reach of War The conclusions, detailed in a report released Friday by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, a federal oversight agency, include the finding that of 2,797 completed projects costing $5.8 billion, Iraqs national government had, by the spring of this year, accepted only 435 projects valued at $501 million. Few transfers to Iraqi national government control have taken place since the current Iraqi government, which is frequently criticized for inaction on matters relating to the American intervention, took office in 2006. The United States often promotes the number of rebuilding projects, like power plants and hospitals, that have been completed in Iraq, citing them as signs of progress in a nation otherwise fraught with violence and political stalemate. But closer examination by the inspector generals office, headed by Stuart W. Bowen Jr., has found that a number of individual projects are crumbling, abandoned or otherwise inoperative only months after the United States declared that they had been successfully completed. The United States always intended to hand over projects to the Iraqi government when they were completed. Although Mr. Bowens latest report is primarily a financial overview, he said in an interview that it raised serious questions on whether the problems his inspectors had found were much more widespread in the reconstruction program. The process of transferring projects to Iraq worked for a while, Mr. Bowen said. But then the new government took over and installed its finance minister, Bayan Jabr, who has been a continuing center of controversy in his various government posts and is formally in charge of the transfers.  After Mr. Jabr took over, that process ceased to function, Mr. Bowen said. In fact, in the first two quarters of 2007, Mr. Bowen said, his inspectors found significant problems in all but 2 of the 12 projects they examined after the United States declared those projects completed. In one of the most recent cases, a $90 million project to overhaul two giant turbines at the Dora power plant in Baghdad failed after completion because employees at the plant did not know how to operate the turbines properly and the wrong fuel was used. The additional power is critically needed in Baghdad, where residents often have only a few hours of electricity a day. Because the Iraqi government will not formally accept projects like the refurbished turbines, the United States is finding someone at the local level to handle the project, handing them the keys and saying, Operate and maintain it,  another official in the inspector generals office said. If the pace of the American rebuilding program is a guide, those problems could quickly accelerate: So far, the United States has declared that $5.8 billion in American taxpayer-financed projects have been completed, but most of the rest of the projects within a $21 billion rebuilding program that Mr. Bowen examined in the report are expected to be finished by the end of this year. Some of that money is also being used to train and equip Iraqi security forces rather than finance construction projects. The report was released too late in the day to contact Mr. Jabr, who is part of a Shiite alliance in charge of the government. In his previous position as interior minister, he was accused of running Shiite death squads out of the ministry. In his current position he has developed a reputation as being slow to release budget money to Iraqi government entities, which would have to run the new projects at substantial expense. He is sometimes suspected of seeking to use his position to undermine the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who is also a Shiite but answers to a different faction within the alliance. In interviews, Mr. Jabr has rejected those accusations and says he strongly supports the government. American researchers who have followed the reconstruction said Mr. Bowens report raised serious new doubts about the program. Rick Barton, co-director of the postconflict reconstruction project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research institute in Washington, said the lack of interest on the part of the Iraqis was the latest demonstration that they were not involved enough in its planning stages. It sort of confirms that you really need pre-agreement on the projects you are attempting, Mr. Barton said, or you end up with these kinds of problems at the tail end, where people dont know much about the program and they havent bought into it. Mr. Barton said that the episode was probably inevitable given that the elected Iraqi government operated mainly within the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad and had little capability of managing thousands of new projects around the country. He said that this was the most likely explanation  rather than any ill will on Mr. Jabrs part. But Mr. Barton said the findings indicated that the United States should put some of the remaining money in the program into sustainment, the term for running the projects, rather than continuing to build when there might be no one to run the projects. To build something and not have these issues resolved from top to bottom is unfathomable, said William L. Nash, a retired general who is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an expert on Middle East reconstruction. The management of the reconstruction program for Iraq has been a near-total disaster from the beginning.  The report says that of the 2,797 projects declared completed, besides the 435 projects formally accepted by Iraqs central government, 1,141 have been transferred to local Iraqi authorities. American government entities in charge of those projects include the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the American-led multinational forces in Iraq, the United States Embassy and the United States Agency for International Development. In letters attached to Mr. Bowens report, several of those entities largely concurred with many of Mr. Bowens findings and said that new agreements were being hammered out with the Iraqi government to smooth the transfers. A spokesman for the development agency, David Snider, said in a statement that work now being undertaken by the agency helps address the concerns raised in the report. Mr. Snider said that the agency was seeking to formalize an agreement with the Iraqi government that would protect the American investment there. The agency usually secures these commitments from recipient governments before the initiation of a project, Mr. Snider said. But in the case of Iraq, he said, the American rebuilding effort began before the current Iraqi government was established. ",no

17472,"Communication is one of the most critical non-technical skills needed in todays workplace. Communicating facts is easy, but adding inferences and conclusions makes it slightly more difficult. Add in personalities, varying backgrounds and expectations (common in our increasingly diverse workplace), and emotions, and things quickly become very complicated. When faced with a difficult situation, such as an underperforming employee, asking for a raise, or dissecting a failed project, most people either avoid the issue (leading to anger and resentment) or confront it  often with disastrous results.  The slim book Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss what Matters Most by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton and Sheila Heen grew out of the Harvard Negotiation Project. It provides tools to help you understand, plan for, and obtain constructive outcomes from these difficult discussions.  The authors main premise is that in any of these charged exchanges, there are really three separate conversations going on.  1. What happened? Each person involved may have seen something different, and probably ascribes different motives to the actions that they saw. 2. What are the emotions involved on each side, and what needs to be done about them?  3. What does this issue, and how I reacted, say about me and who I really am?  The book discusses how to decide which issues need to be discussed, and which can be solved in other ways. If a conversation is needed, they talk about how to start on the right foot, and how to think like a mediator and identify concrete actions to prevent future problems.  Theres a checklist at the back of the book, which you can use when preparing for your next difficult conversation. Give it a try! ",no

My oldest male ancestor - meaning this fellow had a mutation that deviated from his father - lived some 50,000 years ago in the Kenya area. My DNA markers are with the first (That survived) lines in the UK. Even neater is that my ancestors were part of the people who painted the cave art in France.

It seems that we were a see-faring people much earlier than we ever imagined, seeing that the first inhabitants of Australia had to cross over 200 kilometres of open water - and enough to populate it. It has upset many aboriginals as it negates their religions, i.e. they insist they came from the ground in their respective locations, and the DNA tests proves they came from Africa like everyone else - and even have current 'cousins' on other continents.

17920,"Fritz Leiber is often thought of as a science fiction writer, or the creator of the incredible sword & sorcery characters Fafhrd & Gray Mouser but to me, he'll always be one of the very finest practitioners of the weird tale. I've always been in tune with Leiber's idea of strange geometries and predatory monsters from other dimensions. As much as HPL used similar science to explain his entities, I think Leiber was far more successful at utilizing such ideas. His stories, even the early ones, always seemed strangely possible. Lovecraft, with whom he was a correspondent, would no doubt have appreciated the Leiber's work into 1940's and beyond. Reading it now, it seems hard to believe that CONJURE WIFE was written for UNKNOWN WORLDS in 1943. It still holds up as a superior novel of witchcraft. All the more incredible is that Leiber released my all-time favorite horror novel OUR LADY OF DARKNESS in 1977, when he was 67 years old. This novel (which first appeared in shorter form as THE PALE BROWN THING and has much in common with the early weird tale THE SMOKE GHOST) is about ""paramental"" beings and a modern San Francisco distorted by ""megapolisomancy"". It just blows me away every time I read it. It's amazing to read the progression of Leiber's writing, from his unique early 1930's weird stories (look for THE DEALINGS OF DANIEL KESSERICH, a fine Lovecraftian novel written in approx. 1936) all the way to the very early 90's.

18277,"Different measures of obscurity have their strengths and weaknesses. I think to get a real feel for overall obscurity you need to use multiple measures. These are the measures provided by LT (with our numbers appended) Library Size: 5308 Median: 8 Mean: 219 Average Date: 1975 Here are some measures that take just a little bit of processing: Ratio of median to mean: .0365 Largest Shared Library (raw total): 401 Smallest Shared Library listed (raw total): 139 And here are some other measures people have mentioned: % unshared books: 21.9 % unshared books and books shared by only one other library: 30.8 Book 10% from top: 333 Trout Fishing in America Book 10% from bottom: 1 (if 21.9% of your books are unique, then 10% from the bottom has to be unique too) My own addition to the list of measures is to determine what percentage of one's own library the largest and smallest raw total libraries have. Their totals are. For example, the library with the largest raw total has 401 books in common. That is 7.6% of the 5308 books we have in our library. My guess is that less than 10% for the largest library is pretty obscure, while more than 10% for the smallest library is quite unobscure. Here are our totals: Largest raw score %: 7.6% Smallest raw score %: 2.6% And just for trivia's sake, I tried to find the library in the weighted average for which we had the highest percentage of their books. For one library, we owned 71.2% (47 of 66) of their books. I'd be curious to know if anyone has a higher percentage than that for one of their weighted libraries. ",no

18751,"I'm sorta in love with the Pagan series by Catherine Jinks. She writes a lot of other historical fiction too, but I haven't read them. The Pagan series is set in the Crusades, in Jerusalem (and then France), and is about a young man and his Knight. Pagan is a mixed race squire, brought up in a monastery, highly intelligent and very well educated for the time. Roland is religious and doesn't talk much, and sort of just takes orders. And the two of them become very close friends. The history aspects of it are really interesting too, and it paints a vivid picture of life at the time. It's also full of sarcastic humour, as it's told from Pagan's point of view, first person. Usually that doesn't work so well, but it really does for this one. It's both very funny and very very sad, so it's not pure humour. But I love it so much.  It's young adult, but I'm 22 and I love them, and it's definitely very well written. I highly recommend it.

(Christ in a cream cheese sauce.) ""Pagan Kidrouck, sir."" scratch, scratch. he writes very slowly. ""Age?"" ""Sixteen. Sir."" ""Born in?"" ""Bethlehem."" Rockhead looks up. The brain peeps out from behind the brawn. ""Don't worry, sir. It didn't happen in a stable."" Clunk. Another jest falls flat on the ground. ""Rule number one, Kidrouk. In the Order of the Temple you speak only when you're spoken to."" ""Yes, sir."" ""Understand?"" ""yes, sir."" Rockhead smells rich and rare, like a well matured piece of cheese. No baths for the Templars. Hot water is for girls and porridge and other soft, wet things. If a Templar wants a bath he can go and stand in the rain. That's what God put it there for. ""And where did you come from, Kidrouk?"" (The unspoken question: out of a slop bucket?) Rockhead is highly suspicious. You can see what he's thinking. Just look at this runt! Smells like the Infidel and looks like a bedouin boy. Skin the colour of braised almonds. Built like a horsewhip. Black hair. Black eyes. What in the name of God is this Order coming to?

She told me she had bought some interesting new books, and I retorted with ""I remember someone who, some years ago, said 'no more books' "" (wink wink).

I asked if she had chanced upon a box containing all my dad's sf paperbacks. I told her that I was interested in them. (I think I've told about them before - lots of classic sf, he imported them from the US and the UK during the 50's). Yesterday she phoned me to tell that no, HE HAD THROWN THEM AWAY!!! Horror! Argh! He is my own kin, he introduced me to reading in general and sf in particular (and to the LoTR). And he threw his Simaks and Asimovs and Besters and Sturgeons AWAY!!!

As it happens, the last time I rifled through 15 copies of Publishers Weekly in an effort to keep current, I came across this little gem (due out here in November), which got a starred review Taste: The Story of Britain Through Its Cooking Kate Colquhoun. Bloomsbury, $34.95 (480p) ISBN 978-1-59691-410-0  A history of British cooking may sound like the setup for a joke, but what Colquhoun has written is an invaluable work of social history and one of the more fascinating kitchen-related books to cross the Atlantic since the Oxford Companion to Food. Colquhoun (The Busiest Man in England) begins her march through culinary Britain in the pre-Roman era, sifting through archeological evidence on the Orkney coast, and moves steadily toward the present day. Yet what could have been as dry and stale as a biscuit soon yields one interesting fact or minihistory after another. The Roman conquest brought liquamen, a fermented fish condiment and forerunner of Worcestershire sauce. The Middle Ages contributed pastry crusts, and in the court of Elizabeth I there was a total of 13 forks. Spoons, ale, fish, sugar, each makes its appearance in the kitchen or at table, and so, at various times and through various personages, did manners, morals, affectations and decadence. As the pace of innovation and progress accelerates, Colquhoun slows to take in the information, allowing the reader to linger over the provenance of sticky puddings and damask napkins. Her supple BBC-Four-meets-Julia-Child voice is just one of the book's pleasures; another is her interest in etymology. This is a triumph to savor. (Nov.)

Knowing next to nothing about the time or the person, and not being informed enough to form my own opinions one way or the other, I'm looking for some bit of general background or history on which to ground myself. I'm afraid this is not it. Even with my lack of understanding or reference, this just appears to be completely partial and revisionist history making.

I was impressed by Sam's attitude towards achieving things: he wanted to live independently, so he just went and did it. If he wasn't sure how to do something, he experimented until he got it right, or he read up on how to do it and he figured it out from there. That's the kind of attitude you just don't see in people nowadays, especially kids who are the same age as Sam.  In the introduction the author talks about how most people at one point or another want to run away and live off the land, but something stops us. I think she's right; I can remember wanting to do the same thing when I was little, in fact I still want to do it.

I've watched almost all the movies available by Ozu Yasujiro, a wonderful Japanese film director.

I've been trying to find the latter for about a year for under $150 with no luck. So I was amazed to read the saga of this book's printing history by Bordwell himself: http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=59 And even more delighted to find that a free downloadable pdf of the book itself is now available through the Center for Japanese Studies and Michigan University. They have many other volumes, such as Wild Geese by Mori Ogai and Donald Richie's 1971 Japanese Cinema, Film Style and National Character in this project.

I'm glad I listened to the audio version - the cast of characters was really well done. It seemed a bit longer than it needed to be, but that's the Victorian way, I suppose. 3. Cloud Atlas -- David Mitchell -- Some of the passages were just so sweet, there were lines that I re-read over and over again, and read out loud to others, just for the pleasure of turning them over in my mind again. Brilliant writing. There were 6 interwoven stories here...different genres, different voices, different pieces of time and space. Challenging to get into but so worth it in the end. 4. Sense and Sensibility -- Jane Austen = ABANDONED! 5. The Awakening -- Kate Chopin -- finished this 12/2/07. I had no empathy for the main character.

Why not, say, The Virginia Quarterly Review? 069 Museology - The Stranger and The Statesmanor Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder 070 News Media, Journalism, Publishing - Reporting Back: Notes on Journalism by Lillian Ross - Readable but there are lots of other options here. 071 News Media, Journalism, Publishing in North America - The News About the News: American Journalism in Peril by Leonard Downie - Quite good, but again lots of options. 081 General Collections American - Take the Cannoli: Stories from the New World by Sarah Vowell - Love Vowell, but again a fair amount of choice. 082 General collections In English - Fancy reading Bartlett's Quotations from cover to cover?

(And I wanted to search for those, which is how this came up. But maybe I'm the only one out there interested in such reading... And there are nonfiction books about healthy multiple personalities, so I suppose a simple tagmash of the above plus ""fiction"" or ""sf"" would not serve the same purpose.)

It shines on the big house of our Qin family. The Qin family has a pretty daughter. Who calls herself Luofu. Luofu likes the silkworms mulberry leaves. She plucks mulberry leaves at a corner south of the city wall.  Of black silk is the baskets shoulder-band. Of cassia-twigs are the baskets carrying-loops. Her long hair is coiled and piled. Her earrings are full-moon pearls. Her skirt is of pale yellow silken lace. Her jacket of the same in lavender. When a passerby sees Luofu. He sets down his carrying-pole and smoothes his beard. When a youngster sees Luofu. He doffs his schoolcap and dons a mans kerchief. Plowmen drop their plows. Gardeners drop their hoes. Antagonists who came to quarrel. Just sit and stare at Luofu. His Excellency came from the south. His five horses stood there dithering. His Excellency sent a clerk. To ask of whose family is this beauty. The Qin family has a pretty daughter. Who calls herself Luofu. How old is Luofu? Not yet twenty, but well over fifteen. His Excellency addressed himself to Luofu. Mightn't we go for a ride together? Luofu had her refusal prepared: How could Your Excellency be so utterly silly? Your Excellency has a wife of your own. Luofu has a husband of her own. More than a thousand horsemen in the east. My husbands position is as leader of them all. How will you know my husband? A white horse follows a black colt. Black silk binds the horses tail. Pure gold bridles the horses head. At his waist a wellcrank sword. Worth perhaps a zillion or more. A yamen clerk at fifteen, attending courts of high officials at twenty, in a household regiment at thirty, in sole charge of a whole fortress at forty. His character is pure and unsullied. His broad beard juts from his cheeks. Tall and imposing when he walks in public offices. Dignified even when he must hurry on business. Of several thousand men throughout the headquarters. All proclaim him extraordinary. Once you've got the POV sorted out, the sophistication of this poem becomes apparent.

Message edited by its author, Sep 10, 2006, 8:26am. ===================================== Sep 10, 2006, 8:36am Message 23: SqueakyChu  If you can't find a copy, I can send you mine which then will continue on a bookray...although I'd really prefer to keep it until we finish talking about the book here as I can never remember book details once they're out of my hands. :-( I'll finish this book this morning and can say that, of the three books of Yoshimoto's I've read, this is not the one I like the best. I like the other two (Asleep, Lizard) I've read better. Both of these are books of short stories. I was surprised to find out that there are two stories in this book, making it not a novel, but a novella, I guess. I got confused when I started reading the second story because the characters changed names...or so I thought until I realized it was a completely different story. No spoilers here: One thing I've noticed about Yoshimoto's short stories (as I've not yet read any of her full-length novels) is that she is not very explicit about just the things I'd like her to be more explicit about. One thing about the touchstones. If you edit your post, you also have to go back and pick the correct touchstones again. I have Asleep making its rounds as a bookray so that if you end up liking Kitchen, you might also want to read Asleep. That's a book of three stories all based on the topic of sleep. Back to the book... Message edited by its author, Sep 10, 2006, 8:41am. ===================================== Sep 13, 2006, 10:19pm Message 24: Opinicus  While we're reading Kitchen, thought I'd see if there is a book anyone has an idea of for the NEXT Group read? I thought of tracking it down, while doing this, to save time. Since we've just/are reading a book from Japan, what country would we like to read from next? Israel and India have been mentioned so far. ===================================== Sep 13, 2006, 10:19pm Message 25: lohengrin  Korea. ^_^ ===================================== Sep 13, 2006, 10:32pm Message 26: SqueakyChu  I actually am reading two books by Asian authors now. Maybe others might also like to read them. The first is Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami who is a Japanese author whose writing I absolutely adore. It seems this book is not easily obtainable on the used book market because it's very much in demand. I checked the BookMooch stats! I know...another Japanese author...but he's just wonderful. The second is The Hungry Tide by Amitav Ghosh. He is an Indian author. I know nothing about this author or about the book. I found the CD at the library and needed a good book for my commute to and from work. I just started listening to it yesterday. How frequently will you be reading books with us? Once a month? When you say Asian literature, I am assuming that you mean any book written by an author from Asia, not a book by an American about Asia. Am I correct in this assumption? Personally, I'm up for reading a book from just about any country. The more variety, the better. ===================================== Sep 13, 2006, 11:31pm Message 27: Opinicus  For book reads for now, I think it would be best to read book written by 'natives' of that particular country. Maybe later on read some books set in Asia or with Asian characters written by Brit./Amer./Fren./whatever authors whether or not they are of Asian heritage. I personally don't care, but I DO DESPERATELY want to explore books translated into English. All of Murakami's book are high on my list, as well as the rest of Yoshimoto's so far... I'd really like to do a read once or twice or a month depending on how others schedules work. I like variety, even though I am seriously prone to tangents, and will obsess and have to read everything I can on a particular theme/subject/setting/author. I call it ""binge reading"". At the beginning of the summer it was Hong Kong, now I'm slowly drifting towards Japan...for now. Check Asia on Wikipedia for a 'master list of countries'. I know that many of us many have an interest in Southeastern and Eastern and Southern Asia, but I would like to check out some of Western Asia (Middle East). Man, geography sure has changed alot since I was in school, or at least my perceptions of it. Check out the ""notes"" section at the end of the wikipedia. Sorry but Russia will always be in Eastern Europe for me, and the Middle East will away be the Middle East, and Egypt is in Africa--but we can still all talk & explore the literature from there. When I created the group I used Wikipedia as a source for Asia, as I am a westerner and someone from there may have a different view of the world then I do. I thought it safe ground to build from. Would we think it a bit strange if someone created a group called American Fiction, and they were covering North, Central, and South America? Or they did, but excluded the United States of America. So I thought why not all of the countries listed on Wikipedia's article on Asia--and therefore all of asia, asian writers, british/canadian/american--asian authors also apply.. And I AM getting long winded and redundent, and so I'm off to bed as I get up at 3:30am..yawn...night ===================================== Sep 14, 2006, 7:41am Message 28: aluvalibri  what about My name is Red by Orhan Pamuk (Turkey)? ===================================== Sep 14, 2006, 7:57am Message 29: Opinicus  oooooooh! Orhan Pamuk I also found Wayfarer: New Fiction by Korean Women Why don't we make a list of what we have so far: Turkey---Orhan Pamuk Several books available on BookMooch (UK & Ireland), and listed on Amazon Korea---Wayfarer: New Fiction by Korean Women none on Bookmooch, available on Amazon India---Amitav Ghosh --BookMooch (UK), and Amazon China---Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress by Dai Sijie BookMooch & Amazon Based on availability why don't we do China next, then Turkey, India, and Korea?

I would say that, to me, their culture is more Oriental than Occidental...just think about it...exotic, mysterious, etc. etc. That is why I suggested Pamuk. My name is Red is an excellent book. ===================================== Sep 14, 2006, 9:49am Message 34: Opinicus  Yeah, Turkey is in Europe (To Me), but Wikipedia is listing it in Asia---Western Asia (region) Which the majority I associate with ""Middle East"", but hey...I think we are just so used to only thinking of Asia as what Wiki defines as Southern & Eastern & SE Asia.

25297,"Hail, my fellow twenty-somethings! This is a fun idea for a group; often I feel so young in the other groups. People talk about when they first read a book, ""several decades ago"" or some such ridiculous thing. No one here will be doing that, I hope :-P Anyhow, I wanted to ask: what are your plans as a lifelong reader? Do you have a specific goal for what you want your library to be? We have our whole lives in front of us, and we're already smart enough to know that reading is a joy that time doesn't diminish.  For myself, I want to continue collecting children's and young adult books in preparation for when I have children of my own. I plan on homeschooling my children (as I was homeschooled myself) and the idea of a fairly extensive library of our own really appeals to me. Not that we won't haunt the public library too, of course! But all the books in my library are handpicked by me.  I also want to continue collecting the classics. I pick up modern fiction here and there when it's recommended, but I will buy a classic on nothing but a faint recollection of having heard the author's name before. I'm also trying to build my library as much as possible now before we move to a more rural area and I can't slip in to a library booksale somewhere every month.

In the papers, the owners claim that they are going to ''bring literature to the masses''. Its a small independent chain (3 other stores, I believe) and when it was being built, I had high hopes for it.  The inventory has been a little underwhelming, lots of remainders and lots of new material that looks like its destined to become remainder, but I've been thinking that they've just opened, give them time.  So today, I went in there to buy a book for a friend of mine. Its in the children's section, which is the one very well stocked section, so, no problem there--i get a copy of the book. while i'm in the store, i decide to buy myself a copy of A Christmas Carol, since I realized last night that I've misplaced the copy I already had.  I go to the Literature section, thinking that this is an easy pick-up. What bookstore on earth wouldn't have a copy of A Christmas Carol on Dec. 19? well, apparently, this one. All they had were three paperback copies of Barnaby Rudge --no Great Expectations, no David Copperfied and NO CHRISTMAS CAROL. I guess they want to make sure that this Dickens guy takes off. I mean--its kind of unreal. ''literature to the masses'' turns out to not include Charles Dickens?  I asked about it at the info desk and got a sort of blank stare. Then the fellow checked his computer and told me that they had 10 copies of the audio cassete (not even the Patrick Stewart one--perhaps, they asked someone to read who was browsing the the remainders). He asked me if I wanted to order a copy. I told him no, because I work in a library and I could check a copy out for now. The he said, ""Well, maybe I should order one or two copies anyway."" Maybe.

But, they are talking about how there fathers are no longer paying their bills and now they need to find an heiress to marry so the can continue on with the life they have. I remember that she tells one of them that she could help him and to meet her on the terrace/balcony. She there tells him of how she wants him to pretend to want to marry her so that the other gentlemen will pay attention to her also. She offers to pay him for doing this so that he will not be in dire straits or will not need to marry after all, I am not sure which. I remember that he was arrogant, and kind of snotty.

27200,"I tried to post this on New Years, but there were problems that day it seems, and my post seems never to have actually made it into the system.  I had made a list of approx. 25 books I plan to read as last year was such a success, I thought I'd focus more and plan ahead some of the books I want to accomplish. But I'll have to recreate that list, it seems. For now, I'm shooting for 75 in 2008. A 50% increase from my goal of 50 last year, which I achieved and surpassed by a few. Yippe. It's wonderful having this as a record. Here's my first book of the year finished. Prodigal Summer by Barbara Kingsolver This book began wonderfully. Vivid writing of natural spaces and creatures and interestingly drawn, strong, intelligent women. It is a fascinating look at the people of a small, Appalachian town seen from within by a lifelong resident and from a transplant. I found myself fully engrossed immediately.  I read other reviews that complained of Kingsolver's ""preachiness"" and I didn't agree until I was closer to 2/3 of the way through. While I share many of her environmental views and her beliefs in preservation of species and protection of habitat I found it redundant to have different characters give basically the same lecture in 2 or 3 different parts of the story line. Yes, it cemented new knowledge into my head, such as the Volterra principle and the realization that killing the top predators in an ecosystem is more destructive since they are fewer and more ""costly"" genetically to replace...however, I read this book for the beauty of her writing, not for college credit. I have to say, by the last few chapters, she was losing my interest simply for this reason. It took the glow off the joy, so to speak. Quite frankly her writing of the natural world, the way she makes it even more real and personal for the reader is her true strength in winning people to her P.O.V. I found myself pining for the American Chestnut, the Carolina Parakeet and the Red Wolf even before she started soap-boxing the agenda. I have never travelled to Appalachia country, and while I've never not wanted to after seeing it through her words, I find myself feeling a tug of longing to see it myself. I wish she'd just realize how much more powerful it is to give that to a reader in order to compel them to want to preserve it.  As I started, this would have gotten 5 stars. By halfway through, I still would have given it 4 to 4 1/2. By the end, i was weary and ready for it to end, so ultimately, it only gets 3 and 1/2. Still, worth the read. And the characters seem real, true to life, though I couldn't help feeling very sorry for Deanna Wolfe and her complete inability to read other people with anywhere near the skill she reads animal tracks. She's like the friend you want to slap and say, ""wake up! You're missing the point."" And in my opinion, she never really got it. Very disappointing at the end, and her whole relationship left me confused. I wish Barbara Kingsolver had delved a little more into the head and heart of Eddie, instead of our only perspective being through Deanna's perception of him.  ",no

These daughters never leave the house or go to school and the man has brainwashed the Aunt into his way of thinking, which I think is some weird cross between an extreem religion and a desire to protect and control his children. The girl wants a normal life and tries to escape, even to the point of getting out and begging the neighbours to help her but the Aunt and Uncle catch her and tell the neighbours she is mentally disabled and not to pay her any attention. Eventually the middle daughter (who I think is called Helen) becomes caught up in the girl's description of real life, friends, school etc and agrees to help her. The girl pretends to be coming around to the Uncle's way of thinking and is eventually allowed to leave the house in the company of his daughters. They go jogging late at night for exercise with a cover story of looking for a lost puppy. This is how the girl and Helen escape.

I'm not setting myself any numerical challenges or limits--given that it's 16 January and I've got through 15 books so far--but have promised myself that I'll keep a record of all my reading for the first time in years. The year began with a dose of tripe... 01. Grunts! by Mary Gentle A gift from someone determined to change my mind after I had ben horribly rude and dismissive about fantasy novels for adults. (I read a fair amount of childrens fantasy, but get cross with the whole bowing-and-scraping feudal lords-and-swords stuff that infests a lot of adult fantasy work.) And damn him, he was right. This amused the hell out of me. Its written by someone who clearly adores fantasy novels, but also has lost patience with the eternal triumphs of the sweet-singing elfy light-and-good side. It skewers many of the standards, while still working within them. Its sick and twisted, and very funny. (Though some of the orcs-as-marines bits went on a bit.)  02, 03, and 04. Mister Monday, Grim Tuesday and Drowned Wednesday by Garth Nix We moved house over the New Year, and after a couple of weeks of packing, cleaning, and shifting stuff, my brain had shut down, so I read these. (Thats my excuse, and Im sticking to it!) Id read them before, when ill, and had absolutely no recollection of them. Never a good sign. The first one was a promising start to the series, but rubbed me up the wrong way for a couple of reasons: firstly, they feel very written down to age rather that at a natural level for the target readers, and secondly, there was a bad sense of the Mary-Sues about the lead character. Or perhaps its vicarious Mary-Sueness for a particular child reader. Whatever. The lead character is an annoying twit. Interesting world set up, thats alive but not described to death in that and heres another new invention and theres another strange creature manner thats all too common in SF and fantasy novels. It just starts to get thinner and thinner as the series goes on, with a few bright patches that keep you reading (like jumping from safe spot to safe spot in the lava level of an old platform game.) They now live on the to be rehomed pile. 05. Cat-Tale by Mark Twain Id forgotten I had this, but it was unearthed when reshelving after the move. Sweet, silly, and barely more than a bedtime story in length. Lovely illustrations, and some deliciously smart-arse word play, but, not exactly a gripping piece of deathless prose.

Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage by Noah Andre Trudeau: I started this right after New Year's on the urging of a friend. Extremely interesting and detailed book for those who like reading about U.S. history. 2. Bystander by Maxim Gorky. Long (very long) and slow, but in the end it added up to a curiously disturbing picture of the indolence of the Russian gentry in the years leading up to the Russian Revolution. 3. Modern Short Stories: The Uses of Imagination: This is a very nice anthology designed for use in high schools and colleges, as it is broken into sections with a scholarly introduction for each. The stories are, for the most part, classics, by writers like Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, James Agee, etc. This was one of my ""between books."" What's a ""between book""? Well, I've never really liked reading anthologies, be they short story or essay anthologies, from cover to cover all in one go. I find that the works tend to blend together too much if I do that. So I will usually have 8 or so anthologies that I'm in the middle of. Between each full-length novel or history that I read, I will grab four or five of these books and read one story/essay from each. Then I'll move on to my next full length book. Hence, ""between books."" I just read the last story in this book last week, so I'm happily adding it to my Furious 50. So that's it: three books down, 47 to go! I've got a few ""between books"" to read from, and then I'll be staring The Birth of the United States by Jim Bishop.

29220,"Received in mail 2/2/08. This young adult is the first in a second series by author James Dashner. The first series of 4 books about Jimmy Fincher is getting good reviews on Amazon; this one isn't due out until March. I haven't read that series. This book is about a 13-year-old boy who begins receiving mysterious letters with clues which will help him ""save the world"". The tone of the book makes me think of the Artemis Fowl series--it has the same kind of mix of down to earth kids with comic-book type mentors and villains. The latter actually make me think of the Lemony Snicket books. The real kids are well drawn if slightly stereotypical--Tick, our hero, has a great family, a nerdish personality that leads to being bullied, and some kind of luck. This series will fit in well with the likes the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan and the Cinda Chima ""Heir"" series. It is very readable but IMHO will not be a true classic. The set of discussion questions at the end of the book highlight the main themes in a very didactic fashion, but the themes are embedded in the story in a more natural way. For true classics in this line, go to Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising (nothing like the terrible movie) and Diana Wynn Jones Chrestomanci series, as well as Pat Wrede's Dealing with Dragons series and Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles.",no

29693,"Our theme for March is ""social class."" On a basic level, a social class system can be defined as a stratification of power. Depending on the society, one's place can be determined by many factors, including education, wealth, family pedigree, sex, strength, ethnicity. Frequently, classes will develop distinctive attire and manner to further set themselves apart. Some societies have many opportunities for social mobility while others have a more rigid structure. So, pick a book for this month that deals in some way with this theme. When you decide which book you want to read, post here to let us know what you pick! Then, in March, we'll discuss how our authors treated the theme. Any book, any genre--the only requirement is that the book be written by a woman!

Previous winners include Pamuk, Kundera, Saramago, Enquist and Sebald. I also love this prize because it is the only one (as far as Im aware) that honours the marvellous work done by translators the 10,000 prize money is divided equally between author and translator.  The only fly in the ointment this year is that it highlights the stupidity and short-sightedness of co-sponsor, the Arts Council of England, which has recently announced severe cuts to small publishers, thus threatening their very existence, including, ironically, Arcadia, which published last years winner and has two titles on this years list. Bah! The short list of six will be selected at the end of March, and the winner will be announced in May.

The first two (especially the second) took some liberties with condensing the characters and plotlines, but they kept the atmosphere intact and didn't change the characters' personalities. But the third movie was a total fabrication from start to finish. Anne and Gilbert are time-warped into World War I (somehow Anne turned into Rilla, I think)... Gilbert is MIA and Anne goes off in search of him... there is a twisted romance of sorts between Anne and her publisher... I was absolutely aghast. I could not believe that Sullivan would produce such an atrocity after the much-beloved first two Anne movies.  My husband and I just finished watching Tales from Avonlea, the miniseries very loosely based on The Story Girl, Chronicles of Avonlea and Further Chronicles of Avonlea books. They were enjoyable but I didn't think they were as good as the Anne movies.  So what are your thoughts on the adaptations? Are there any other than the Sullivan ones I've mentioned? I would LOVE to see a good adaptation of the Emily books....",no

The Curtain: an essay in seven parts by Milan Kundera Finished my first book of my new reading year (only read the first part in the old year). This was a really excellent read -- a series of essays on the novel. It was informative and thoughtful. Like some of his other works I have read it was made up of small parts that came together as a whole. He has a rigorous idea of the novel, without limiting it at all by his analysis -- the writing made his ideas and the idea of the novel for me come more to life and it has certainly inspired me to read several of the classics mentioned to know better how far I agree with all of his points. Edit - he has a deceptively light touch, which makes his writing thoroughly enjoyable. There was one point I did not agree with -- he claims that people for whom life is wholly and unrestrictedly sacred find any joke an affront to that sacredness. I might be able to agree partially with this, for some people. But the point seems to fall down if I consider the example of some Buddhists.

32668,Right now I am reading A HANDMAID'S TALE for the very first time and I am enjoying it a lot. I would hate to live in a future like what Margaret Atwood describes in the book. It is real depressing with all the rules and regulations they have to live by. Another time period I would hate to live in is the one in Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury Unfortunately I have never gotten around to actually reading the book though I have seen the movie several times. To live in a society where they burn books seems terrible. I know I would be one of the people living in the secret society where they memorize their favorite book word by word so it will live on after they die and will not be lost for future generations. Why don't they all just sit down and write the book down on paper instead of learning how to memorize an entire book? I think I would have a very difficult time trying to remember one of  Stephen King's long books like IT or The STAND FOR THE FIRST TIME COMPLETE AND UNEDITED Edition or even of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles to name a few. I guess they burned all of the libraries and bookstores in their society. Librarianwannabe,no

Banks manages to weave themes, and eventually the characters' stories, together in a way that completely drew me in.

Meanwhile, a British couple deal with the war and, as in Continental Drift, the characters' experiences draw them into the same story.  Has anybody else read either of these?

Furthermore there has always been much speculation that Olver was Gaidal Cain Reborn, though Jordan has killed that line of thought. He claims that Olver is not GC, but that he serves a purpose in the story (rescuing Moiraine?)  What I don't get is: Jordan said *apparently* that Olver could not be GC due to timing differences, ie Olver is too old. Now Olver is but a wee lad, so GC in his current incarnation would be even younger... I can't see a 8year old ugly boy running at screaming Shadowspawn.  So what's the deal? Would they suddenly, when the Horn sounds, return to their archetype bodies/incarnations to battle?  That would be a let down for me personally, as Jordan's plots and world are so flaming well thought out that it would be a bit of 'rush job' for his Heroes (some of the most interesting characters in the books) to just Power Up like some badly written Power Rangers type scenario.

Its undergoing a minor revival in the UK at the moment, with Festival at the Edge and various other venues. I've spent the last ten years listening to professional storytellers in various different venues (mainly camps and festivals) and I unashamedly love it. Personally, I don't think I could do it. I can't even tell jokes, so remembering enough of a structure to tell a story is way above me (let alone the singing,that's usually involved). It's not a matter of remembering every single word, but you have to get the story in the right order, and include certain points so later make sense. There's also an element of acting involved, which takes enormous talent. Watching a man wave his arms and be able to see him turning into a bird shows that he's doing it right. Also, to reach a level where you can do it for a living, you have to have a huge amount of capital to plow into it, to go around all the festivals and camps and fairs and build up an audience. So, has anyone else watched a storyteller? Is anyone a storyteller? Would anyone rather do it than on-the-page writing? Oh, and is anyone going to Festival at the Edge this year?",no

This story was part of a collection I read when I was young (?70's prob). It's one of the usual fairy stories except I haven't been able to find it in any collections since. This is the only story I remember so if anyone can remember ANY collections with it in I'd be very grateful. Usual thing, young prince is born, fairies come around & prophecy that he will meet his death. It will be either at the hands of a dog, an alligator/crocodile or a snake. Parents put him in a tower to keep him safe, he see's a dog & they let him have it has a pet (fools!!), I think time then passes, he goes on a trip to meet his bride - who manages to save him from at least 2 of his 'fates' - puts out a dish of milk with sleeping potion & kills the snake & drags him out of the river when the dog knocks him in - can't remember what she did with the crocodile.

It's a radio show where famous people (not so much the current celebs as writers, film producers, politicians etc) have to nominate 8 records they would take with them if they had to be stranded on a desert island (they get a record player too, which opens a whole can of worms about electricity supplies to this island or where to get new batteries, but we book people won't have to worry about that). So who needs all those records? When I'm stuck on a desert island I want to be able to read so when you're shipwrecked from my boat you can take 12 books (cutting the list down that far was hard enough!), plus all the paper and pens you need to write that novel you know you're going to write one day. Just to start off, my list - like most people's, I suspect - morphs a bit from time to time but this is as good as I've got yet (in no particular order): Middlemarch Captain Corelli's Mandolin The Grapes of Wrath The Crimson Petal and the White The Remains of the Day A Prayer for Owen Meany The Deptford Trilogy The Magus Jude the Obscure Life of Pi To Kill a Mockingbird Great Expectations As always with these lists, the problem is what to leave out, rather than what to put in. I've limited myself to one book per author which meant only one Michel Faber, only one George Eliot, only one John Irving, only one (there are tears in my eyes now) ONLY ONE JOHN STEINBECK (and how I did that I'll never know!)

The book was a horror story about a town where people are disappearing. Someone finally figures out that the people are actually turning into trees.

37067,"This message has been flagged by multiple users and is no longer displayed (show)Shazzle Seeks to establish a logical structure for information on the internet.  What We Aim to Do: Shazzle is a state-of-the-art internet application which will both replace many functions of the browser and bring structure to the internet. Check us out at www.shazzle.com for more information. Currently, the World Wide Web handles text only because it was designed to read hyper-text, meaning it does not recognize actual pieces of data. Shazzles ability to handle and recognize data will allow users to access the internet with the same data organizing functionality they now have on their hard drive. This organizational ability represents major step towards location independent computing. Appropriately, Shazzles underlying technology is protected by 7 patent applications.  How Shazzle Improves Search: Currently, searching for information on the internet requires hitting the right sequence of text to retrieve the information a user is looking for. A web-based search requires the user to have a well formulated question in mind prior to searching. There is no real way to browse the internet for information. This problem stems from the webs inability to handle data. Because of this inability, it is nearly impossible to organize content on any sort of web hierarchy. On Shazzle, however, every web-site (called a community in Shazzle because it is more robust than a traditional web site) has an assigned, logical place on our hierarchy. Users may employ a traditional text search, but they can also use the Shazzle hierarchy either to browse for general information or communities (when the user might not have a very specific or well-phrased question in mind) or else to navigate to the exact sub-category that houses the exact type of information or communities that they are looking for. The Shazzle hierarchy solves the text search limitations of homographs and synonyms. A user searching for Paris will be able to tell from the context of the hierarchy whether the pulled community refers to Paris France or Paris Hilton. The user would be able to click either topic within the hierarchical tree and retrieve all communities specifically about that Paris only. Similarly, because a community creator can use multiple tags, and because Shazzle will recognize major synonyms of certain topics, a search for lawyers will return the same results as a search for attorneys, or, for that matter, a search for just lawyer. The point is, Shazzle frees the user from being a slave to text. The user no longer has to play the guessing game to figure out just what word or words will yield the best results. Shazzle gives more precise results because it handles information as the data it is, instead of trying to discern the properties of data through text-only.  Why We Seek Librarian Help: As you may imagine, creating a viable, logical hierarchy in an important yet by no means simple task. While our hierarchy will expand over time with suggestions from our users, we need to make sure our basic structure is solid and intuitive. Who better to help us classify data and information than librarians?  What We Offer: Anyone who contributes to this project will be appropriately credited and cited on the Shazzle web page and the application itself. Shazzle will need full time editorial help in maintaining the hierarchy as it grows. We believe a well crafted hierarchy will become an index and search standard for years to come much like the Dewey Decimal System for cataloguing. Attach your name to this project.  Basic Rules for the Hierarchy that We Cannot Change: 1.	We dont want more than roughly 20 level one categories. 2.	Both level one and level two categories will be visible to any user searching the hierarchy without clicking anything. We hope this will help the users get a sense of what kinds of categories go under each umbrella category.  3.	We cant have more than 100 combined level one and level two categories. Right now there are 17 level one categories and 75 level two categories.  And now, the hierarchy: Note: This is not formatting properly.

Lessons Not Learned was apparently meant to be a hard-headed critique of the U.S. Navy, but it's mostly an exercise in Canadian anti-Americanism. This is compared to What We Need, in which Barrett Tillman combines a sensible military critique with a demonstration that he might be the last man in America to believe in the ""Axis of Evil."" I expected better from the man. Now I'm reading To Conquer Hell; appropriately grim reading for Memorial Day.",no

37582,"I just finished reading The Historian. It's a good book (good as in it was enjoyable, but I'll probably never read it again), but it really didn't have the feel of a horror book. I also felt that the ending was a bit anticlimatic, though maybe after consuming 800 pages Elizabeth Kostova probably realized that she needed to start wrapping it up.

I am sick to death of detectives who are carrying a shedload of mental, emotional and physical problems, with ghastly marriages, guilt complexes and constant brain storms. I've enjoyed Peter Robinson, Michael Connelly, John Rickard, Jasper Fforde, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Ngaio Marsh, Dorothy L Sayers, Marjorie Allingham.

3768,"Africa: Matthew Head wrote several mysteies set in Central Africa, such as The Congo Venus and The Cabinda Affair, they have a nice Anglo-American vibe as the narrator is English, but two other recurring characters are American ladies, a doctor and a missionary. I have enjoyed them a lot. Elspeth Huxley of The Flame Trees of Thika fame, wrote three mysteries set in colonial East Africa -- Murder on Safari, The African Poison Murders and Murder at Government House. Robert Wilson, who has had recent success with mysteries and thrillers set in Portugal, wrote an earlier series set in West Africa, starting with Instruments of Darkness and followed by The Big Killing. The stories are pretty good, but quite violent. The first was notable for the elaborate and sometimes showstopping metaphors the author liked to use.

Date: Sunday 1st June 2008 (starting this evening). Time: 20:00 to 22:00 (2 hours long). Shylock, by Arnold Wesker. A new perspective on an age-old story by one of the foremost playwrights of his generation. Shylock's close friend Antonio needs a loan, but 16th century Venetian law discriminates against Jews. For Shylock's own protection, Antonio persuades him to agree a bond. They laugh as Shylock invents the absurd forfeit of a pound of flesh - but their mockery of the law may easily turn to tragedy.

37987,"Another book that I acquired earlier in the year was the new Garrigues guide to The Birds of Costa Rica. It aims to be an alternative to the long-time standard Guide to the birds of Costa Rica by Stiles & Skutch, which is now almost 20 years old and showing its age.  This is not a new edition of Stiles & Skutch, but a lighter, more concise, field-oriented alternative. The first feature most visitors will enjoy is the reduction in bulk: it is half the weight of the earlier guide. It also features plates, text and maps on one double spread, illustrates all mainland species and provides up-to-date bird names, following AOU taxonomy. Although the new guide does not really supersede Stiles & Skutch, I know that this is the guide that most birders will want to take in the field now. It is the portable guide that birding visitors and general travellers have been waiting for all these years.  At a time when so many neotropical avifaunas are treated in two volume works  a field guide and a species accounts or distribution tome  one might view Birds of Costa Rica in the same light: Garrigues is the field guide, while Stiles & Skutch provides the detail. I'll be in Costa Rica in a month's time, using this guide in the field alongside my older field guide and will post any further comments after that.",no

38354,"As I watch oil and gas climb and the cost of fuel in general rise, I cannot help but wonder what the next source of energy will be. I mean we have to switch over at some point, yes? We won't let this oil crisis completely destroy our world economy right? However I have mixed feelings on what we could do. Here is a short list that's been running through my head 1.  Nuclear Power : Already working well in the US Naval fleet, and in a limited number of power plants in the U.S. However there are serious questions about the effect on the workers who operate it and what is to be done with waste. In addition, my understanding is that current regulations are not friendly to allowing more plants to be built 2.  Wind Power : Very green, very renewable, but can it work in more than a few places? How much can it really produce enough energy? This seems like one of the better resources for the world to use where able 3.  Solar Energy : Again, clean, renewable but limited to only sunny areas and there are questions about efficiency and life-span of the panels. Im very undereducated on this source though. 4.  Bio-fuels : Im against this mostly on the principle that it hurts hungry poor people by raising prices on food they need. Also, it decreases MPG in most vehicles on the road, which seems counterintuitive. 5.  Increasing exploration and production of oil : This will help in the short-term, and Im in favor of it for now, but were going to run out eventually and then were screwed. Feel free to disagree, trash my claims, or put forth better ideas. This is a cursory examination and Im an amateur, at best, in this subject. I am looking for more info and others opinions.  ",no

He went on to report other startling statistics about the percentage of illegals unemployed, getting government assistance, commiting crimes, in gangs, and in jails. My gripe is that that a country does not exist without borders: borders are a line in that sand that says, ""laws apply here, they don't apply on the other side of that line."" Without borders we do not have a secure place where our laws apply, we do not have a firm foundation upon which to define citizenship. Everyone congress person and the president and the cabinet take an oath to protect the USA, which is defined by its borders. Moreover, they take an oath to protect American citizens abroad--when was the last time our elected officials, let alone our entrenched permanent bureauocracy local, state, and national, upheld their oaths?

40938,"Here's my first attempt to pull together some conclusionssome consensus, some not.  1. The OSC is for shelf order, not something more ambitious.  2. OSC should be composed of levels, separated by either ""-"" or "":"" 3. The system should be built on the assumption that libraries will pick how far to ""go down"" the levels, based on the collection size or whatever. 4. Each level can contain either letters or numbers. If letters, sorting will be alphabetical. If numbers, sorting will be numeric, not digit-by-digit. 5. The top level should be fairly atomic, so that top-level categories correspond to real, concrete areas of interest, not abstract catch-all phrases for these areas. We want a section for medicine, for example, not for ""life sciences.""  6. Whatever we do, the we should leave a lot of ""space."" So, for example, if the top level is to be alphabetic, let's use A, D, G and avoid the letters in between. 7. Before the classification a library may choose to indicate a ""place"" facet, eg., DVD 12:1234:123, LOCALHIST 112:1234:123, BKMBILE 12:312:12 are all possible. 8. At the end of the topic-based part of the classification should come an indication of how to sort books within the topicby author mostly. We can leave aside the question of whether this is dealt with by spelling out the name, in whole or in part, or whether to ""cutter-ize"" the name into a number. We can leave this aside because we don't need to solve it now and because, IMHO, this doesn't need to be solved globallyit's a data display issue, not a ""real"" data issue. 9. We should seriously consider the ""patterns"" of DDC. I proposed that all patterns be numeric and all other classification components be alphabetic. Or the reverse. I like this idea, but that's as far as I'll go there. Those are my feelings. I am asking replies to be structured by these, if not too burdensome.",no

Here's an excerpt from a piece by Francine Prose on Paul Bowles in HARPER'S that is instructive: ""Paul Bowles' stories give the lie to the platitudes of those earnest creative writing instructors who like to tell their students that the well done short story requires its protagonist to be transformed in the course of the narrative, to experience some life-altering (and preferably life-affirming) Joycean epiphany. Few of Bowles' characters end up any wiser than they were when they began, though many are notably sadder."" The classic story arc. Dramatic tension. Conflict.

(August 19) Breakfast with Buddha by Roland Merullo: Road trips can be a blast or a nightmare, depending on who your traveling companion is.

It just didn't fit into my reading tastes. BUT, I was surprised at its boldness and its ability to remain unbiased both politically and religiously. It truly is a great read!

44271,"I found this book years ago in a book clearance shop and bought it because I liked the painting on the cover. But the story is so good it was immediately one of my favourites. Hana lives in Chekeslovakia with her son in a house she inherited from her aunt. From a troubled childhood with a deceased mother and a father in prison for telling the wrong sort of joke, Hana moves on to a troubled adulthood, still in love with her exciled ex-lover and raising the son he doesn't know they have. Until one day she decides to travel to England and tell him, thinking that this will reunite them. But Hana's holiday causes trouble for her whole community and those who care for her. This book is really touching, very funny in places and really captures the spirit of the country and the times. Only one other person on Library Thing has it listed, which is a shame because it is a truly great book (Shearrob I know you are hoarding it somewhere though).

44479,I read about book about six or seven years. I remember the cover was blue and it was a thick book maybe 300 or 400 pages long.  The book was about a boy in a magical world being kidnapp by a woman who could not bear children. Years later people from this world go looking for the boy and find that he is living with a regular family and they watch the family. They find the boy is very spoiled and rude. They try to take him back to his world but he will not go back so instead they take the little servant boy that lives with the family and is mistreated. When they return to their world they find that the servant boy is the real lost boy and the other child was born to the woman shortly after she kidnapped the boy from the magical world. I believe that the door to the magical world only opened at certain times but I'm not sure. If you have any ideas please let me know!,yes
44610,"LONDON, Aug. 25 -- The daughter of Margaret Thatcher has disclosed that Britain's former prime minister is suffering from dementia, in the family's first public confirmation of what has been widely rumored in Britain for several years.  Thatcher's condition has deteriorated so much that she forgets that her husband, Denis Thatcher, died in 2003, her daughter reports in a memoir to be published next month, serialized over the weekend in the Mail on Sunday newspaper.  ""I had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again,"" Carol Thatcher wrote. ""Every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years, she'd look at me sadly and say 'Oh' as I struggled to compose myself. 'Were we all there?' she'd ask softly. It's probably not very conservative for me to say this, but I don't believe there is anything remotely dignified about in aging in such a manner, nor dying in such a manner.

Really, really full of that stuff, including a tour through the ship that acquaints the reader, as well as one of the characters, with every part of a ship. This detail, while fascinating in its way, slowed down the narrative. I want my adventures full of adventure and this story seemed very pedestrian. I missed Hornblower and Bush.

By October, I had read 16 books and my average reading was rising from two to three books. And then, along came Bodily Harm. The other part of my Resolution, was to finish every book I picked up. This book was so hard to read, so dull, that I very nearly lost my resolve. I did finish it though, and now is the time to add it to my lists, to rate it and review it. My problem arises because I simply cannot write this book off as a complete failure. I can't give it 1 or 2 out of 5.

4574,"I know this will descend into an argument but I think we really are all mature enough to keep it civil. Please. SF and fantasy: Where do you draw the line? Is there a line? Where does the difference lie? This follows from a few posts that have included Anne Mccaffery's pern series as fantasy and China Mieville's Perdido Station as fantasy. To me there is a distinction: both types and indeed nearly all fiction are about people and how they behave. To be SF the technology has also to be key, items that we haven't made but could make, might someday make, the way that they intereact with the universe: These have all to have been thought about by the author. Spaceships don't just go from a-b they pass by gravity etc. For fantasy there is no such requirement - if you want fantasy on an alien world the characters can just start there - or they can arrive but the physics of the arrival doesn't effect the plot. There is no requirement to ground effects int he world we know, other than to keep the readers comprehension.  I don't consider the divide as technology and no -technology becasue the way that the characters interact with the technology also counts. Now to me, Pern is fantasy:Its got dragons in it, and the aspects of technology that appear, are not plot devices, and could be replaced with magic, they are not explained, they just are.  Mieville's worlds are too physical for me to read them as fantasy, they are connected to the our world through the Chaos Energies, and I read them as a strange SF. Then there are genuine crossover books that sit squarely in the middle Cherryh;s Morgaine saga for example.  What do you think? Should their be a divide, and where is the line drawn?",no

47290,"Hi all. I hope this hasn't been covered before, but... I'm trying to figure out how to deal with books that have multiple editions. The ""book details"" panel doesn't seem to provide an interface for selecting another edition, and the interface for adding books from external sources (I use Amazon) is too clunky to select the right edition of each book you add. So I have a library packed with editions of books that are not the ones I own and not the oldest. I.e., arbitrary. I've been selecting covers to make it look more like my real library, but the book info is generally for some arbitrary edition. Relatedly, the ""work details"" panel doesn't seem to have information about how many other editions of a book there are, or (more usefully) the earliest publication date for any of them. Wouldn't it be a reasonable, if not perfect, heuristic for identifying the original publication date? I.e., if the earliest published edition for a work is 1974, and the work has 20 editions, you can be pretty sure that's when it was published. Doesn't work for Aristotle, does work for Don Delillo. Also, seems like this info could be added in a single crawl of the database and maintained pretty easily thereafter. Aside from all that, if I wanted to get a list of the different editions (or the oldest or newest editions) of the books I own, can that be done? I poked through the APIs, but didn't see anything that would give me information about other editions, unless you can get that with a title search.

47987,"Hi, Just wanted to sign in and introduce myself to those at the board. I am an Aussie fantasy lover from earliest teens, raised on a diet of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkein and now happy to sit and munch a good ripe cheese with a tankard of frothy ale. I ended up writing a fantasy book because, obviously there are no more CS Lewis or Tolkein books to buy (although they still seem to find ways of re-packaging the same material and The Children of Hurin was well worth the read). I was also thinking that lots of fantasy books are getting very dark. Life is dark enough without feeling bad when I sit down with a book to enjoy a great read. So 8 years ago I started mucking around with ideas for the book that is now called Beckwood Brae. That is a constructed name and the site of an ancient battle that forms the backdrop to the book. Hope you guys like it. I would really like to know if the themes that I have woven into the book are evident. I always believed that what an author thinks can't really be hidden. You reveal a lot about yourself in your books - whether you want to or not.  To start with can I tell you what are my favourite bits in any of the fantasy books I have read over the years. The first is from the speach of Elrond, (from memory; close enough to:) ""The road must be trod but it will be very hard and neither strength or wisdom will carry us very far along it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope of success as the strong, for such is oft the way of deeds that move the wheals of the world, small hands do them because they must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere."" Its kind of the synopsis of the book isn't it. and from The Horse and his Boy, "" I do not call you unfortunate, said the large voice."" ""Don't you think it was unlucky to be chased by so many lions?""  ""There was only one lion... I was the lion... who forced you to join with Aravis, I was the cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead. I was the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept. I was the lion who gave the horses the new strength of fear so that you could reach King Lune in time. And I was the lion, you do not remember, who pushed the boat where you lay, a child near death so it would be found by a fisherman , wakeful at midnight to receive you."" So I am a tough reader to please. A book has to inspire and touch me somehow. I just hope I can live up to my own standards. If Tolkein and Lewis represent that standard - it will be hard. Dave ",no

49404,"Posting a new topic: Forgotten Authors... I'd picked up a copy of The Incredible Casanova by James Stuart Montgomery, published in 1950. Turns that Montgomery was local to my area (The ""Main Line"" in Pennsylvania), and this copy of his book was inscribed by the author to a local couple. Just a few chapters in, and I'm finding it to be a fun read. As I tend to stick with authors that I enjoy, I got to researching James Stuart Montgomery (beyond the notes on the dust jacket - and his other works.) Needless to say, I couldn't find much information about him - even on LibraryThing! This got me to wondering just how many other favorite ""forgotten authors"" there might be out there. I can throw out one more: Joseph Jay Deiss. I've had an interest in renaissance Italian mercenaries, the ""Condottieri"" and came across a copy of Mr.Deiss' 1966 book, Captains of Fortune, Profiles of Six Italian Condottieri. Unlike James Stuart Montgomery, Mr.Deiss rates a ""Wikipedia"" article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Jay_Deiss Addtionally, Mr.Deiss ended his days as a ""a courtesy professor in the Classics Department of the University of Florida."" (quoting from the University of Florida website...) In fact, the University of Florida has an endowed scholarship in his honor, the Joseph Jay Deiss Memorial Scholarship for Summer Studies in Rome. My point? (You might well ask...) Well, having read and enjoyed Carlos Ruis Zafon's 2001 book, The Shadow of the Wind, I remember the ""Cemetery of Lost Books"" - ""a huge library of old, forgotten titles lovingly preserved by a select few initiates."" (to quote the Wikipedia article...) I thought that it might prove to be a fun exercise to build my own ""Cemetery of Lost Books"", and I've started with Montgomery and Deiss - and I thought that I would see if fellow LibaryThingers would be interested in commenting on their favorite ""lost authors"" as well. I'm using three criteria:  First) You have to really and truly like the author's book (or book) that you recommend, and  Second) The author should have written more than one book. (although, hey, I can be flexible if it's a truly amazing book...) Third) It can't be a popular (or well known) author that you've just discovered. (e.g. just found out about this guy, Billy Shakespeare - what great plays, everybody should read his stuff! if you get my meaning...) So... have at it!

Librarything is wonderful :) I am a pagan and experimental magician living in Seattle; while I enjoy collecting occult books, I also enjoy putting them to good use--I refuse to be an armchair magician, and there's only so much you can learn about a topic through its theory. And I like studying topics related to occultism, including psychology and mythology, among others.  My bibliophilia extends to the point that I write my own books; my first one is Fang and Fur, Blood and Bone. I'm also an editor and publicity director for my publisher, Immanion Press. As for the specific flavor of books discussed here, I've read a few of Aleister Crowley's works (I especially loved ""Magick Without Tears"" (which LT seems to be having trouble recognizing as a touchstone). I also now have, thanks to marrying my husband, Taylor Ellwood, access to the works of William G. Gray and Franz Bardon, which are on my to-read list (a very long list indeed!).  I'd be curious to know what members of the group think of newer forms of occultism, particularly Chaos magic, which defy the artificial divide between ""high"" and ""low"" magic and instead concentrate on ""effective"" magic. I'd also be interested on folks' thoughts on modern interpretations of older forms of magic, such as Lon Milo Duquette's The Chicken Qabalah of Rabbi Lamed Ben Clifford and Tony Mierzwicki's Graeco-Egyptian Magick.

NBER: U.S. In Recession That Began Last December Reuters ran an interesting sidebar that lists U.S. recessions back to 1923. It makes interesting reading, as it highlights one of the key difference between Republican and Democratic administrations. Since March of 1929 there have been 10 Democratic administrations and 10 Republican administrations in the White House. Look at the economy over the past 80 years (and assume - as seems likely - that we'll still be in recession until Inaugural Day next month): In those 480 months of Republican presidents, the nation was in recession for 144 months: 30% of the time. In those 478 months of Democratic presidents, the nation was in recession for 38 months: 8% of the time. This is not a small difference: the economy is nearly four times as likely to be in recession when there's a Republican in the White House. In 40 years of Democratic administrations - two generations - the economy lost just over 3 years of growth. In 40 years of Republican administrations, the economy lost twelve years of growth - over half a generation of growth lost, in just two generations of Republican governance. In just my lifetime, there's been one Democratic recession - which lasted six months - and eight Republican recessions (which have lasted 89 months to date). The one Democratic recession I've lived through was the shortest recession since at least the '20s. Every one of the eight Republican recessions was longer than that single Democratic recession.

After he went into politics, he became known by the nickname ""Old Kinderhook."" Soon people were saying ""Is it OK?"" reffering to Van Buren, and the word okay was derived.

Van Buren made three unsuccessful bids for reelection. His autobiography does not mention his wife once. Van Buren took $100,000, the sum of his salary as president over four years, in a lump sum at the end of his term. Of Dutch ancestry, Van Buren and his wife spoke Dutch at home. Martin Van Buren's favorite foods were oysters, doughnuts, raisins, figs, and apples. Van Buren owned two tiger cubs as pets.  Van Buren's favorite sport was riding horses.

At some point he acquires this magic instrument, either an ocarina or flute, I think. Sorry, I know this isn't very good, but its been a long time since I read this.

Spain My Brother's Gun by Ray Loriga I think this story could have been set in many countries of the world; it treats the general subjects of life, death, crime and family, and also depicts the mechanisms of the media, which are similar in many countries - similar tv shows, similar exploitation of people's private lives.",no

Edi Gathegi confirms that the Twilight follow up New Moon starts shooting in March. He says he will reprise his role as the nomadic rogue vampire Laurent in the next film version directed by Chris Weitz and based on the Stephenie Meyer saga. Gathegi, who's currently promoting his part as Deputy Martin in the just released My Bloody Valentine 3D, reports that the new vampire movie would be shooting in Vancouver, Rome and Los Angeles. ""I am looking forward to working with Chris Weitz,"" notes Gathegi. And while Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke is a Gathegi friend, he maintains there was no hard feelings when the director decided not to return for the next one. ""It was a mutual decision,"" he adds. ""I don't think she'd want me to feel sorry for her."" Despite Twilight's mediocre reviews, Hardwicke's vampire picture went on to surprise pundits earning more than US $303 million world wide, nearly double the total anticipated for the film that cost $37 million to make. As it is, Gathegi says he feels overwhelmed by all things Twilight, first making the film in early 2008 and then promoting it around the globe after the movie was released in November. ""Nothing lasts forever,"" says the 29-year-old actor who was previously most recognized for his Dr. Cole part in the hit series House. ""So I am going to enjoy it all over again, and this time I am actually looking forward to it."" The bonus for Gathegi is that Twilight fanatics usually don't know who he is. ""I don't have my character's dreads so I can get away with having dinner or taking in a movie,"" he says smiling. We'll see how long that lasts.",no

56184,"Strange as it sounds, those are the primary things I remember about this book. There were 3 or more sections of the book and each section was a short story.  The first story of the book involved a family living on a lake, raising children for the colony and one of the moms had come to visit since she was in the area, analyzing tomato plants. The children told her all about the ""monster"" of their lake, which they thought might be a real moose. The main character is a scientist whose job is to make sure the plants brought with the colonists from earth are not about to spawn anything odd or nasty, which in the first story, she runs across misquitoes on the lake. The earth plants have a genetic code embedded in them that when they flower red, a new species emerges from the plant. So naturally, when someone saw a red tomato, they reported it, and she had to clear an entire field of red tomato plants so the populace wouldn't burn them. In the second story, the main character convinced her superiors to allow her to revive some bats out of the ship stores, once she discovered that bats ate insects. And the third story was about a native bird and some carnivorous cane that grew on an island where they were raising miniature cows.

Well it turns out that Laurence is the Author and Catherine is the illustrator. Is there anyway to change the data to reflect this (other than just re-editing my own data)?",no

57263,"It would appear to me that more and more readers are tuning in to audio versions of their favorite books, so I gave it a try the other day and, quite frankly, hated it. Now, bearing in mind that first and foremost this kindly old cumudgeon has reached an age where change is another word for diapers, I can hardly imagine my relinquishing the God-given gift of appreciating the written word, and the eyes, to appreciate such an object of affection. Still the very thought of seeing such literary treasure buried by the sands of time (I rather liked that phrase) upsets me greatly. After all, what is a kindle? I thought it was an object that pricked Snow White's finger, putting her to sleep, which caused her to miss the all those Stephen King novels. Need I ask about a touch stone? Fortunately my son is available from the his room, or else I doubt I would be writing this missive, so ignorant am I of this computer toy that I continually attempt, in my zeal, to screw up (my sons words). Perhaps these are some of the reasons a six-year-old urchin advised me the other day to 'move into the 21st century, you old geezer'. I venture to say that I drooled all over him. I digress. It surely pains me (arthritis perhaps) to think that one day soon I will be unable to lift from my book shelf some rare tome that I have treasured and hoarded, for as long as the library allows, to savor the glorious, written word on some piece of vellum(?), and, instead, to have to stick some contraption in my ear in order to take my pleasure from the book. Yes, move into the new century, but for Lord's sake leave me to my books, most of which have been recommended by LibraryThingers. I so revere those half-hours locked in my bathroom, away from the screaming kids, where I may savor the literary delights printed there on those perfect pages. Am I alone in my thoughts, has my oncoming senility blurred my senses, will I no longer salivate at the thought of Harold Robbins' latest? (I jest of course, really, honestly). The only thing I want stuck in my ear is my wife's wet finger, can't help it, I like it. The thought of listening to some drone read to me via the car radio or some such contraption unnerves me even more. If, heavens forbid, I no longer have the capabilities to be able to read the golden words for myself, as many poor souls do, then I can live with that, but, please don't take my books away, I'll be good, I promise.

These will not be discussed for months, which means one will have all that time to hit library sales or used bookshops, if needed:-) Also, keep in mind that this group encourages one to read not only literature from outside your own country, but translated from a language not your own whenever possible.

Holidays Read a book that has a holiday as a part of the story (i.e. Chinese New Year, Australia Day, Boxing Day, Christmas, Chanukah, Mother's Day, Polish Independence Day...etc) Imprisonment While imprisonment does not have to be the central theme, it should figure as a major part of the story. (i.e. This Blinding Absence of Light by Tahar Ben Jelloun, True Notebooks by Mark Salzman, Stolen Lives by Malika Oufkir) Aboriginal Peoples Literature written by native Americans, First Nation, Aboriginal Australians, Native Africans...etc.) Dictators and Other World Leaders or Dictators or Dictatorships  Nature or Being Close to the Land. This is pretty broad, from Petterson's Out Stealing Horses to McGahern's The White Earth to Molly Gloss' Jump-off Creek ... Work and Workplace novels Either one used as an important element of the novel, perhaps even as theme.

I remember a little bit from the book about Arthur giving a banknote to some poor fellow/beggar he knows. But - not the whole note but just a half of it, saying it would be something special. The second half he gives to that woman, and she, in turn, meets that fella and gives him her own half. If I'm not mistaken, in the title there is a word ""moon"".

But she has spent the eighteen years since then haunted by his ghost, by her guilt and by her fear that someday, someone will find out her secret. And it seems that day has come. A lifetime of hiding and trying to make herself invisible is blown apart in an instant with the delivery of an anonymous note, the first of many, and blows Beth's carefully guarded life apart.

My language is English, but feel free to discuss words you love from any language. Lets see now, to start off, mine, as they occur to me randomly From slang coined in my lifetime, chillax.

Well, the colonists weren't aware of this when they decided to settle there. When the creatures came out of hibernation after their arrival all the adults in the colony were devoured and the only survivors were the children who were taking their classes inside the landed and partially cannibalized spacecraft that took them to that world. They were left alone with only the ship's AI to help them survive. The story is set just before the bugs are due to come out of hibernation for a second time.

It was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written by N. P. Willis: ""We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second number of the ""American Review,"" the following remarkable poem by Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of 'fugitive poetry' ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and 'pokerishness.'

LONDON (Reuters)  Two out of three Britons have lied about reading books they have not, and George Orwell's ""1984"" tops the literary fib list, according to a survey published Thursday. Commissioned by organizers of World Book Day, an annual celebration of reading in Britain, the study also shows that the author people really enjoy reading is J.K. Rowling, creator of the bestselling Harry Potter wizard series. According to the survey, 65 percent of people have pretended to have read books, and of those, 42 percent singled out ""1984."" Next on the list came ""War and Peace"" by Leo Tolstoy and in third place was James Joyce's ""Ulysses."" The Bible was in fourth position, and newly elected President Barack Obama's autobiography ""Dreams from My Father"" came ninth. Aside from a list of ten titles which respondents were asked to tick or leave blank, many admitted wrongly claiming they had read other ""classics"" including Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, Charles Dickens, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Herman Melville. Asked why they had lied about reading a book, the main reason was to impress the person they were speaking to. The study, carried out on the World Book Day website in January and February, surveyed 1,342 members of the public. Those who lied have claimed to have read: 1. 1984 - George Orwell (42 percent) 2. War and Peace - Leo Tolstoy (31) 3. Ulysses - James Joyce (25) 4. The Bible (24) 5. Madame Bovary - Gustave Flaubert (16) 6. A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking (15) 7.

61917,"In the course of pulling books out of storage boxes, I discovered an old ""classic"" adventure tale that I didn't know was there. I decided to give it a quick read to see if I should keep or toss it. Setup: The hero has just narrowly escaped being carved up by the High Priestess of a lost tribe, as a sacrifice to the Gods. She has taken a fancy to him, and is helping him to escape. They are having a chat about her religion. She says: 'It is the duty of a high priestess to instruct, to interpret --- according to the creed that others, wiser than herself, have laid down; but there is nothing in the creed which says that she must believe. The more one knows of one's religion the less one believes --- no one knows more of mine than I.' I think I'll keep the book, just for that gem.

Provides a cautionary text for a new administration that will inherit autocratic allies, penal colonies, reliance on coercive power, and pervasive cynicism about Americas declared global arms.

Geoffrey Wheatcroft, The New York Times Book Review The author is such a lively writer that Id be hard pressed to find dull patches in this whooper of a book . . . Brendons narrative is wonderfully stocked with generals, politicians, rugged adventurers, consuls, eccentrics, administrators, and famous imperial hands. Matthew Price, Boston Globe A richly detailed, lucid account of how the British Empire grew and grewand then, not quite inexorably, fell apart. --Kirkus ""A book of enormous range and complexity and leavened with a splendid sense of wit and irony. It takes courage to emulate the great Gibbon, but Brendon succeeds magnificently. And while there may be many books on the British Empire, this is undoubtedly the most entertaining and the best."" --Dominic Sandbrook, The Evening Standard ""A masterpiece of a historical narrative. No review can hope to do justice to the depth of Brendon's research, the balance and originality of his conclusions, or the quality and humor of his prose. Our imperial story has been crying out for a top-flight historian who can write. Now it has one."" --Saul David, Literary Review ""Brilliant . . .

62733,"Reviewed here It doesn't touchstone but the work is Mushroom miscellany by Patrick Harding ""Fascinating.  Broadly split into three topics, the first covers basic biology of this the Fifth and some say largest and most diverse Kingdom of Life. What most people think of as a mushroom is in fact the fruiting body of a much more complex mycelium. And while the fruitbody barely lasts a fortnight the organism underneath continues to grow, the oldest recorded specimen is over 1500 yo - much older than an oak tree! and can weigh over 10 tonnes - more than a blue whale. Such titbits of trivia are woven around and though a simplified descriptions of the lifecycles of different types of fungi. There are lots of Latin words and a brief overview of the arguments between scientists over the correct names.  The next and longest section details the specifics of a few particular examples. Why the Jews Ear has nothing to do with religion, where you can find a Penny bun. etc. Interleaving the short chapters are wonderful detailed photos of the various species being discussed.  Finally there's a cultural section. This segues neatly on from the 2nd by starting with the specifics and then more generalities of various moulds, rusts, rots and pests - all of which are fungi. It goes onto discus culinary and recreational uses, and finally the portrayal of mushrooms in the media and literature. There is a surprising amount of chemistry here - mostly restricted to compound names, but of interest to anyone with a science background and possibly confusing for less experienced readers. This is absolutely not a field guide. However it has been written by a mycologist with years of experience in collecting and eating mushrooms and Patrick Harding has written definitive field guides. The text is very easy to understand and flows well. The full Latin names are given for every species wherever they are mentioned, but this isn't disrupting. There are a few attempts at puns to close chapters, and these are generally very weak. Don't give up your day job to become a comedian Patrick.  It's well worth reading for anyone who loves mushrooms, completely identifies with the Hobbits in Lord of the Rings when Farmer Maggot feeds them, wonders why toadstools don't attract or repeal toads, what the difference is and why some cultures eat more and a greater range of mushrooms than others, and in fact anyone who is just vaguely curious about the world around them.

There were cats everywhere, and the scenery was that of what you'd see in the country. The book progresses over roads and hills, all the while cats filling the land. I'm not sure if there was an exact person walking/looking at the cats or not.  At the end of the book, a single cat is focused on, and I believe the reader is given the whole, ""Look, a cat just right for me!"" kind of deal. I think it was smaller than the other cats. Now that I think about it, perhaps the cat itself was walking through looking at all the other cats?

63989,"I have the following ARCs available for trade in the US (PM me if you're interested): Hiding in the Spotlight: A Musical Prodigy's Story of Survival by Greg Dawson--Berdyansk, Ukraine 1931: At the age of six, Zhanna has developed a repertoire of a student twice her age, given her first public performance, and been offered scholarships to the most prestigious conservatories in the Soviet Union that had produced legends like Rachmaninoff and Horowitz. Then, disaster strikes. The Nazi Army is smashing through the Ukraine en route to Moscos. Zhanna and her family are to be executed alongside thousands of others in the ravines of Dorbitsky Yar. A few short miles from certain death, she escapes into the forest with only the clothes on her back and a copy of Chopin's Fantasy Impromptu in her pocket. Adopting a new identity and ever fearful of recognition, Zhanna roams the ravaged countryside. One lonely evening, the head oa a local Nazi battalion hears her play and is so taken with her exquisite talent that little Zhanna soon becomes the performing darling of the Nazi forces. A nocturne on the strength of the human spirit, Zhanna's story is powerful, haunting, and unforgettable. Outcasts United by Warren St. John--Clarkston, Georgia was a fading Southern town until it was designated a settlement center for refugees in the 1990s, becoming the first American home for scores of families in flight from the world's war zones. The town also became home ot Luma Mufleh, an American-educated woman from Jordan, who volunteered to coach a youth soccer program for Clarkston's refugee children. They named themselves the Fugees. Originating in an acclaimed series of front-page articles in the New York Times, this is the long-awaited story of the Fugees, played out against the backdrop of an American town that, without its consent, had become a vast experiment in getting along. Driven by the fast-paced narrative of a season that saw the team and its young players pushed to the brink, Outcasts United is a brilliantly reported, moving chronicle of a small town struggling to become a global community, the resilience and hope of a group of young refugees, and how we find home in a changing world. The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane by Katherine Howe--Connie Goodwin should be spending her summer doing research for her Ph.D. dissertation in American History. But when her mother asks her to handle the sale of Connie's grandmother's abandoned home near Salem, she's compelled to help. One day, while exploring the dusty bookshelves in the study, Connie discovers an ancient key, and within the key is a brittle slip of pper with tow workds written on it: Deliverance Dane. Along with a handsome steeplejack named Sam, Connie begins to reserach Deliverance Dane. But even as the pieces fall into place, Connie is haunted by visions of long ago, and she fears that she is more tied to Salem's dark past than shoe could have ever imagined. Mistress Shakespeare by Karen Harper--Elizabethan beauty Anne Whateley records intimate details of her dangerous, daring life and her great love, William Shakespeare. As historical records show, Anne Whateley of Temple Grafton is betrothed to Will just days before he is forced to wed the pregnant Anne Hathaway. The secret Whateley-Shakespeare match is a meeting of hearts and heads that no one--not even Queen Elizabeth or her spymasters--can destroy. Often at odds, always in love, the couple sells Will's first palys, and as he climbs to theatrical power in England, they fight off fierce competition from other London dramatists, some as treacherous as they are talented. Persecution and plague, insurrection and inferno, friends and foes, even executions of those they hold dear, bring Anne's heartending story to live. Spanning half a century of Elizabethan and Jacobean history and sweeping from the lowest reaches of society to the royal court, this richly textured novel tells the real story of Shakespeare in love. Etta by Gerald Kolpan--Debut author Gerald Kolpan brings to life the extraordinary story of one of the twentieth century's most beautiful, brave, and mysterious women--as it might have been lived. Next to nothing is known about the real Etta Place--where she came from, what her real name was, or what became of her after her legendary romance with the Sundance Kid. This spellbinding novel imagines that Etta is a Pliladelphia debutante whose father's death leaves her orphaned, bankrupt, and a target of the infamous Blank Hand mafia. She then flees west using an alias: the name of the street on which she grew up. Weaving together diary entries, Pinkerton Detective Agency memos, newspaper articles, and historical documents (all richly imagined), Gerald Kolpan makes a fiction debut that is both captivating and unforgettable. Some of the Dead are Still Breathing by Charles Bowden--I'd describe this one as a collection of intelligent musings about the current troubled state of the world. Here's the Amazon description: ""In this seminal book, Bowden turns his fearless gaze toward the futurethe future we can feel hurtling toward us, as fuel reserves dwindle, species die out, terrorism flourishes, the Earth warms, and our ability to be fully awakealert and impassioned in our liveswanes. Weaving together natural history, memoir, reportage, and sheer virtuosic writing, he takes us on a furious tour of our emerging reality, his observations from the borderlandsof nations, laws, species, and desireall the more searing for his refusal to be our scourge. Bowden has always had the gift of prophecy, but Some of the Dead Are Still Breathing is proof that the times have caught up with his vision, and need it now more than ever.""",no

Gods Gardeners, a religious group who have dedicated themselves to the preservation of Earths plant and animal life, have long predicted it and have honed their survival skills for decades. Two women have survived the flood: Ren, a young trapeze dancer at Scales & Tails, a high end sex club, is locked in a comfortable isolation room at the club, and Toby, the manager of a luxurious spa, is barricaded there, and subsisting on some small food stocks and the edible spa treatments. Both women have lengthy past ties to Gods Gardeners. What will survival entail in a world which has become a strange, savage, and decaying place practically overnight? Atwood has created a inventive and riveting parallel story to that of Oryx, Crake and Jimmy, set in the same dystopian future in roughly the same time frame, except this story is set in the Pleeblands --- the rough urban areas outside of the secure corporate compounds we became familiar with in Oryx and Crake. The book is divided into thirteen chapters, each named after a holiday observed by Gods Gardeners (i.e. Saint Dian Day...as in Dian Fossey) and each with a short homily by the leader, Adam One, and an appropriate hymn for the occasion. In subchapters, the reader alternates between Ren and Torys survival in the present day, and the back story of their lives and that of Gods Gardeners. No two stories set in the same time and place can be entirely detached from one another, and so this parallel story is not always, truly parallel and this and her previous novel slip back and forth across each other, but the how of this is best left to your own discovery. Atwood has created a mesmerizing story, filled with social commentary and a sharp gallows humor, yet also compassionate, thought-provoking, and ultimately hopeful. *While one probably doesn't have to have read Oryx & Crake before reading this new one, I think it certainly would enhance the reading of it.",no

However, the professionalisation of medicine in the later medieval period, and the development of university faculties of medicine excluded women from the profession. Abbess Hildegard of Bingen wrote the Liber simplicis medicinae (Simple Book of Medicine) around 1160. Another famous woman physician was the Italian Trotula of Salerno, whose works on women's ailments spread across Europe, her name being Anglicised in England to Dame Trot. A Sister Ann is described as a medica at St Leonard's Hospital, York, in 1276. Even after the fourteenth century women continued to function as midwives. A midwife generally learned her trade apprenticed to a more experienced midwife, or else was taught by a father or husband who was a physician. The only qualification needed was a statement from a parish priest declaring that she was of good character. Women also served as nurses in the monastic orders, although there were also some secular nurses, caring for the physical needs of patients. ",no

66642,"I have seen how private health insurance in the US can contribute to inefficiencies and inequities. Below, the MDs themselves are said to cause problems through overprescription of tests and procedures. The President wants a bill on his desk by October. How ever can the system, with all its complexities and interestspatients, MDs, private insurers--be fixed?? The primary cause of McAllens (TX town) extreme costs was, very simply, the across-the-board overuse of medicine.  Americans like to believe that, with most things, more is better. But research suggests that where medicine is concerned it may actually be worse Two economists  found that the more money Medicare spent per person in a given state the lower that states quality ranking tended to be. In fact, the four states with the highest levels of spendingLouisiana, Texas, California, and Floridawere near the bottom of the national rankings on the quality of patient care.  They found that patients in higher-spending regions received sixty per cent more care than elsewhere. They got more frequent tests and procedures, more visits with specialists, and more frequent admission to hospitals. Yet they did no better than other patients, whether this was measured in terms of survival, their ability to function, or satisfaction with the care they received. If anything, they seemed to do worse.Fisher found that patients in high-cost areas were actually less likely to receive low-cost preventive services, such as flu and pneumonia vaccines, faced longer waits at doctor and emergency-room visits, and were less likely to have a primary-care physician. They got more of the stuff that cost more, but not more of what they needed.Health-care costs ultimately arise from the accumulation of individual decisions doctors make about which services and treatments to write an order for. The most expensive piece of medical equipment, as the saying goes, is a doctors pen. And, as a rule, hospital executives dont own the pen caps. Doctors do. As economists have often pointed out, we pay doctors for quantity, not quality. As they point out less often, we also pay them as individuals, rather than as members of a team working together for their patients. Both practices have made for serious problems.The lesson of the high-quality, low-cost communities is that someone has to be accountable for the totality of care. Otherwise, you get a system that has no brakes. You get McAllen.

66830,"Heres an interesting set of links prompted by perusing todays Jihad Watch. The Muslim Advisor in question, Dalia Mogahed, was appointed by President Obama as the first Muslim woman to be a member of the White House Advisory Council on Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships. I put her role in quotation marks because though her title technically makes her an advisor, it presumably isnt the case that shes, as it were, standing at Obamas side whispering, etc. (The pro-Muslim party Turkish newspaper Todays Zamannot Jihad Watchcalled her that.) Todays Jihad Watch story is here. The Jihad Watch bio of the Turkish Khomeini, Fethullah Glen,in voluntary exile from Turkey since 1998, is  here . It references a story on Glen from  AsiaNews , an apparently pro-Christian or pro-Catholic, Asian news source. The interview with Dalia Mogahed in Todays Zaman is here. Also interesting is a long video discussion/debate between Mogahed and Irshad Manji, author of The Trouble with Islam Today. Mogahed seems to have moderate credentials, co-authoring a book with the American professor of Islamic Studies John Esposito, among other things. But its interesting how her moderate approach puts her squarely at odds with Manji. Manji puts herself in the category of a reformist. She calls herself a Muslim and believes that there is nothing necessarily or irredeemably wrong with classical or original Islam--and a great deal right about it--but that Islam as it exists today is in need of a reformation perhaps akin to the Christian Reformation. Now, as much as I like Manji, I would disagree with her on the thesis that Islam can be reformedas well, perhaps, with her historical interpretation of our actual Reformation, etc. Yet one would think that her position is the quintessential one of a moderate or liberal Muslim. It is difficult to argue that Islam today does not need to be reformed given, among other things, the actual or in practice restrictions on apostasy or conversion that exist in all majority Muslim countries, or the restrictions on womans rights, etc. that exist in most of them. But in that case, why is someone like Manji at best marginalized, or at worst condemned by Muslim groups and their supporters in the United States and elsewhere (typically, she has been under threat and thus under protection, etc., etc.). And why does a supposedly moderate or mainstream Muslim such as Mogahed put herself squarely in opposition to her? Bringing us back to the original question, why does Obamas Muslim Advisor support the Turkish Khomeni? Is it that the current Administration doesnt know or doesnt care about her views, or those of her allies? Or is that it would be difficult to find a prominent Muslim authority or spokesperson who would have different views? (In fairness, the Bush Administration in it's attempt to ""reach out"" to moderate Muslims or Muslim groups in the United States perhaps confronted the same conundrum.) ",no

66986,"I just read The Writing Life by Annie Dillard. I thought I wouldn't like it but it is a really amazing book. It's really mind-expanding. I took her advice and made up my own writing space. The uglier the better.  Here is a picture: http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb269/jhensley_1979/MyWritingSpace.jpg She talked about being in a room full of cinder blocks and her only view being of tar and gravel. Sure, there were other places she wrote that weren't as spartan, but she was really able to zone out in this one. So, I used the ugliest thing I could think of to put in front of my computer. I put up brown craft paper. It's like a paper bag rolled out in one strip. I stapled it to my wall. It's perfect, because in the book, she also talks about making drawings that have to do with the characters. So, I wrote out some themes to short stories, which may become a novel, and I drew some pictures too. This book really changed how I look at writing. I need to write for the reader, not someone who just went to the movies and expects a movie in a book. I know, I was going to write mystery, and I still might, but I felt like the plot I made was so contrived. These literary stories I'm writing are just coming out of me. I do disagree with her on one thing. She says that a book takes 2-10 years to write and that it is rare that it takes less. Well, I think it can take less. I'm not saying write everything in a month. There is nothing wrong with that, I tried it and liked it, but I think 6 months to a year is a good amount of time to write something. I was thinking 3 months to write the first draft, a couple of weeks to put it away and then look at it and edit it and revise it and put it away again. Then do one final edit.

67740,"Ok, what got me thinking about this (amongst other things) was a comment that suggested that Soviet communism was an accurate reflection of Marxist ideas. Most people who identify themselves as Marxists (at least in Western Europe/USA) would regard Soviet communism as not Marxist in much the same way as people who identify themselves as Christians would regard the Inquisition as not Christian.  Here's my own postmodern take on it. Marxism, amongst other things, is a theory of historical development, that has a certain relativistic aspect to it. Historical change is driven by class conflict. And each class has it's own idea of rationality, what is good, and identifies it's own interests as what is good, what is rational, with goodness and rationality itself, objective reality. When one class supersedes another as the dominant force in society, then it incorporates what is of value in the previous ruling class while discarding anything that is not progressive. (Note that Marx spoke approvingly of capitalism insofar as it was revolutionary force that dismantled feudalism, aristocracy, and traditionalism. If Marx regarded capitalism as evil, it was only in so far that it attempted to hold back the forces of change that it unleashed and stop historical progress.) Ok, I'm with him when he's looking backward and explaining how we got to this point. But when Marx starts talking about communism and revolution, he stops being a historian and starts becoming a philosopher (by philosopher, I'm using a derogatory sense of the word, someone who thinks they can stand outside of tradition or history and critique it from an objective point of view that is not reliant on any particularly culture, class interest, or tradition)/poet/prophet. He stops doing what he called ""scientific socialism"" and starts doing precisely what he criticizes as utopian socialism. He trades his historical relativism (I'm using relativism here in a sense that does not disqualify the idea of historical progress) for an ahistoricism that lays the groundwork for dictatorship/authoritarianism. It assumes that at some point there will be as Frances Fukuyama once said, an ""end to history"".  If Marx's account of history is correct, and history is a tale of classes who thought their values/way of life was the omega of history, only to be superseded by others, isn't the idea of a revolution that attains some sort of ideal utopian society an invitation to authoritarianism/repression? An invitation to attempt to stop the forces of change (once the alleged ideal society had been attained)? I have no doubt that Marx would have been repulsed by the Soviet Union. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the ahistorical/utopian elements of Marxism might not have laid the groundwork for such a state having become possible. And I would go so far as to say that any worldview that has a utopian aspect has dictatorial implications lurking somewhere in it's background.",no

I'm finding the solution untenable based on my notion of what is generally thought about a priori (even considering Kant's earlier work) and I'm not convinced that his treatments of the good will, duty, and the hypothetical/categorical imperatives address the situation. What is it about morality that can be pointed to that is a priori? I remain confused. And it's noted even in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that Kant vacillated concerning whether morality really has an a priori 'component' or if it's based upon experience.

69007,"This is going to sound a little retarded, but here goes: I am beginning to see the reflection of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged in the ideology of the Republican Party. Now, I know the response to this admission by any thinking person is, Duh. but for me this is a real revelation. I know that newly minted Republican staffers and such on both the Hill and the White House, as part of their indoctrination is to receive, read, and become more than passingly familiar with the themes and concepts presented in the book. As a result, presented here in no particular order, are some thoughts about the relevance of Atlas Shrugged to American Republican politics today. 1) Sarah Palin - Sarah Palin is the Dagney Taggart of the Republican Party. She's a cute, spunky woman fighting against the waves of Lilliputian minds who seek to drive her from office for their own reasons of petty jealousy and fear of her dazzling brilliance. She is the consummate individual, bound to go her own way. Anyone who opposes her has impure motives and is prima facie destroying one of the good people. Palin, just like Dagney, doesn't have to be smart, she doesn't need to know a lot of stuff, she just needs to be independent and opposed to government getting in her way. Given the opportunity, she, and by implication the rest of us, if only given a chance could make the trains run on time through sheer force of will, except for all the little people, tugging at her, trying to pull her down to their level. It doesn't matter that her childhood friend and best friend in adult life is a thief, stealing the patrimony of another land, or that one of her heroes is a pirate. These are people who do whatever is necessary to extend their will into the world as far as possible, the rest of us be damned. 2)Industrialism  Most of the heroes in Atlas Shrugged are industrialists of one sort or another. They are proud rapers of the land, as I said above, pirates, or just dropouts from society. About a quarter of the book is spent tracking down a guy who invented a perpetual motion machine, for God's sake. No wonder the Republicans love this book, it's about transcendent people who transcend even the laws of nature. They create steel that never wears, never shows the results of stress and strain, that never contributes to any problems. The story of what it took to invent and then sell Riordan Steel in the face of roadblocks and problems put up by an array of bad guys from government and unions is a truly inspiring story of will in the face of concerted denial. 3) Environmentalism  Unfortunately, this was not a problem for Rand. In 1957 evironmentalism was the province of small bands of kooks with no real footprint in society. I say this is unfortunate because Atlas Shrugged contains little if any direction for Republicans to take on the subject. They don't know what to do. Taking several other themes of the book, private property rights and extreme individualism into account Republicans can cobble together environmental positions based on how the issue limits ownership and individual rights. The idea of government owning property is, of course, abhorent. Only individuals have the right to own property. I suspect this comes out of Rand's youth under Stalin. She is very much opposed to any form of communal action, except of course when her prized individuals band together to withdraw their expertise from society, forming a smallish community with a very strong governing principle that all who participate must contribute. Sounds a lot like communism to me, from each according to his ability to the community according to it's need, but then what do I know. And of course this leads me to the next topic: 4) Unions  There are two kinds of workers in Atlas Shrugged, those who follow the vision of one of the great individuals, the good guys, and those who form and join unions. The good employee, as far as the fact that he neither owns nor directs the company will allow, follows the lead of those who do. They are appropriately sycophantic and relentlessly push the bosses agenda. They are content to be like puppies in the shadow of greatness, their contributions recognized as those of loyal servants. They have little or no sense of accomplishment in themselves, their singular purpose is to support the boss. Of course the bad guys are the unions. They collude with government and the financiers (a class Rand seems to have little respect for) in organizing the business legal structure to their own advantage. Of course this is the source of myriad roadblocks, theft, corruption, and just plain stupidity. From this Republicans conclude government can not work. They've read Ayn Rand and she told them so. The polemic on unions (while Dagney is hunting for the inventor of the perpetual motion machine) is classic. The union forms, apparently only for the purpose of destroying the business. Sponging off the profits reaped by ownership, demanding such things as a fair wage for a fair days work, health care, daycare, vacation, etc. all those things workers who are no longer just thankful they have a job, but demand some say in what their labor has wrought drives the owners out leaving the company to the union which immediately runs it into the ground, the same way Republicans when given the controls of a community drive that community into the ground, and the same reason they demand things like unitary presidents because the collective (that's you and me, folks) is not individually wilful to do what has to be done. Better we are led by a single individual with a vision thingy than an arguing, chattering, oppositional government. You know, Like Stalin. One strong individual with a will is better than fifty congresses. 5) Capitalism - The underlying theme of this entire book is the economy of will. Part of that economy is the free ability of the strong willed to make any deal they see fit, to use capital as a weapon as well as a force for good and, since government is bad, must be completely free to operate as the god of Republicanism, all knowing, all seeing, all encompassing, a neutral arbiter of success. Of course the fact this ends up in depression and the destruction of the middle class (the enemy of the good) is just what the doctor ordered. Society needs to be shaken out every now and again to keep the cream rising to the top. the fact that this shake up can have life and death ramifications for the rest of us is immaterial. 6) Going Galt  The strong willed individual, when thwarted does what all good Republicans do: they whine and run away, demanding that their narcissistic demands be met before they return to save the rest of us from ourselves. Oh, my! What a bunch of Heroes.When Achilleus did this at Troy it didn't work out so well for the Achaians, and made Achilleus look childish and eventually cost him the life of his dearest friend. Apparently, for a brief period, the threat of going Galt was, I guess supposed to terrify us, but since most Americans, including, apparently, themselves have never read The Illiad, it just sounded kind of dumb. Of course the fact that they kidnapped most of those who went Galt, including Dagney, is immaterial. Once again, they are the strong in a time when strength is needed, they must do what they must do to survive and thrive. If that means spying on people for no good reason, torturing people for no good reason, starting wars for no good reason, lying to us and to themselves to create the world they need in which to be relevant, then by God, that's what it takes. Trust me, says Dick Cheney, and a hundred million or more eyeballs click too in a straight ahead blank stare, like a zombie, shouting feed me, oh master, feed me, lurching around, trying to turn the rest of us into zombies as well. So, to recap, everything the Republican Party stands for is exemplified in this one book Atlas Shrugged. Of course the world created in this book is an impossible, idealized world, (did Rand ever write a book about what her ideal world would really look like? Or did she just whine about how things were?) so the Republican vision is equally impossible and idealized (have the Republicans ever presented a vision of what the world they want to make would really look like?). Aside from problems attendant to living in Neverland this is a false vision, one centered on the individual not the community, but just as equally flawed. As the communist world dictates a strong hand on the nascent individualism within each person of the community, so does this world require a strong hand to keep the community from demanding a say in how they live, too. Unlike Galt's little community where everyone does what they are told, no? The central conceit of this book, the only ones who count are those who command their fates, is a phony conceit. How many of you out there who celebrate this dream are named Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs, or Edison, or Ford, or Rockefeller? My guess not a damn one. In fact Bill Gates is reviled, along with Warren Buffet and George Soros, titans all, for using their money for social purposes rather than like Scrooge McDuck who has it all slopped into great mounds of coin doing nothing except feeding his own ego. How many who follow this philosophy are actually in a position to enjoy its benefits. As with most about this book issues that require some level of thought, like how to actually, you know, like help one another, as we are, by the way, commanded to do by Jesus, another star in the firmament of the right wing, a man and God whose whole philosophy of life is completely antithetical to the themes of this book (one of the reasons right wing Christianism makes no sense when examined in the light of what Jesus actually said) are ignored altogether, or given some sort of facile treatment that doesn't amount to much. In other words, if you are a nine-to-five kind of guy then you don't count in terms of the clash of worlds taking place over your heads. You just have to live with the results. Let your betters determine what that should be. I'm sure there is much more in this book about how the truly great are shat upon by us small minded folks, those who resent being used like pawns in a power game that can only end badly for them. No matter what you may be told, Atlas Shrugged is the true bible of Republicanism. The purpose of said book is to lull us into thinking a handful of narcissists has our own best interest at heart. The existence of the Republican party demonstrates the success of this philosophy.",no

True. Neither do our Ralphs. Relying on his biography in the Wikipedia, I find that he was born in 1952, making him of military age in 1970. The war in Viet Nam being at its height, he went to Europe for ten years. Rough duty, it was. Cirrhosis always looms in those beer gardens. He retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel in intelligence. (Officers usually being peters, it is not surprising that Peters was an officer.) In the Marines we referred to such people as admin pogues or REMFs, rear-echelon motherfuckers. I confess to a loathing for those who shelter safely behind the lines yet send others to fight, bowwow, grrrr, woof. Still, his record is not irrelevant to his views. War looks exciting to office workers, but has less appeal to those who are forced to fight. It has even less appeal for those who are hit. I remember lying in the NSA hospital in Danang, across the way from some guys whose tank had been hit by an RPG. I couldnt see them because my face was bandaged. Still, we talked. They were badly burned, but seemed likely to live, though with ghastly scars. The RPG had ruptured the hydraulics, they said, and the cherry juice cooked off. The two across from me had gotten out. The other two crewmen had burned to death. Apparently they screamed a lot. You panic, it hurts, you are blinded, you cant find the hatches, that kind of thing. I could tell a lot of stories like that. I dont because then I get very strange and want to hit something. A loud-mouthed REMF, for example.",no

69974,"In the early/mid 1990's I checked a book out of the library and am trying to figure out what it was. It was historical fiction, set in the middle ages, I believe. I think the main character's name was Tristan. What I remember of the book is this: in the beginning of the book, there was a fire that destroyed a library (maybe in a monastery? maybe in a castle or some other compound) and the main character was able to save some of the books/scrolls/parchments and escape through a hidden gate or door in the wall. There may have been a monk or something similar who helped him. I thought the book was titled ""The Gate in the Wall"" but have never been able to find a book by that title that fits what I can remember. I think the author's last name may have been towards the middle of the alphabet (G-P), rather than at the beginning or closer to the end, but that's only because I vaguely remember finding it in the middle stacks of my library. I think the book may have been one of several that the author wrote - again, this is a vague recollection that may or may not be correct. I believe the opening part of the book may have been set in Asia Minor, the Mideast, or Southern Europe I'm thinking perhaps Constantinople or Jerusalem and that the main character then returned to England after escaping from the fire.

70275,"Ok this is my first draft of for this book. It needs a bit of work so I'd appreciate comments. I gave it 4.5 stars. Last Call by JD Seamus *********************************************** Nathan Melton is an ex-football player, turned internet start-up manager. He's moved to the big apple to start an internet based company and has no personal social network. One night feeling the need for some female companionship, Nathan hits a few of the local bars and strikes out. On his way home he stops by an ATM to refill his dwindling cash supply when he's mugged at knife point. Two cops who had been on stakeout nearby hoping this mugger would show up, 'rescue' Nathan after a little mix-up. After sending the perp to booking the 2 cops bring Nathan to 'Jimmies' for a drink and to show no hard feelings. This is where his New York social circle comes into being. Nathan and Jimmie become friends and we follow both as they perpetually get into 'situations' and back out again. This was an excellent book and I fully enjoyed it from beginning to end. Last Call was classified as a mystery, but since the 'mystery' that needed solving was revealed in the opening chapter, the only mystery was 'when do we get to that part?' The book is funny and entertaining and you always wonder whats coming next. Some things are telegraphed fairly blatantly to keep you wondering not 'if' but 'when' it's going to happen. We meet Jimmie and the group through Nathan, a recent transplant to 'the City' (New York for the rest of us) and how their friendships grow. Ultimately, Jimmie leaves a legacy to take care of his Daughter who is severely mentally handicapped, and his wife who is getting to the latter stages of MS, and the legacy disappears. Jimmie's friends find out about the missing money and more hi jinks ensue as they attempt to discover the thief and return the loot.",no

70978,"A memory  I recall cold mornings in the little white shotgun house where I was raised. My Grandma would wake me up for school and I would smell fresh coffee and other kitchen smells throughout the house. Grandpa and ""the girls"" had already gone to work, leaving me to crawl out from underneath a stack of blankets sometime later.  At 5 years old and already the statistical product of divorced parents, my mother and I lived with her parents and two of her younger sisters.  While scratching the grit from the corners of my eyes, I would crawl into the hard wooden chair at the little round kitchen table, with cold toes and fingers and expectancy. My favorites were her homemade buttermilk biscuits or pancakes, but the fun part was cutting a chunk of cold syrup from the lip of a metal can. I could sit and try to pour it out all morning, but the rebellious dark ""pure cane"" syrup would only hang outside the can's open mouth like a cold tongue. I found that if you put the biscuits on the cold syrup, they were also immediately cold.  Necessity became the mother of invention and I still remember the process as if it were yesterday.  After slicing off a nice sized dot of syrup, then came the butter mixing. I would hack off a slice of butter with a fork, which I kneaded and squashed together until the butter and syrup developed a soft consistency of paste. Timing was everything and the steaming biscuits - or pancakes would make it all worthwhile.  So, is it quick wit or a clever turn of verse that makes a writer memorable? Or is it the level of education that causes one to quickly float to the top of literary acuity? I propose that one major component is the ability to convey vivid memories, thoughts, ideas and imaginings with clarity and an emotional openness, enticing the audience to exercise all available sensory perceptions from the words on your page. Part of your goal should be to compel your beloved reader to slow down their pace and ruminate over meanings instead of the verbiage. Compel them to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel with tactile acuity the emotional anchor the writer is trying to convey. Not an easy task without a deep communion from your own heart.  I propose that the romantics are not dead, just very few are willing to pour out their heart and soul to a microwave mindset audience. It would be the same as speed-reading the cliff notes of Romeo and Juliet and expecting to gain an understanding of the emotional depth of love that would be willing to die for. Do I expect a revival of Gautier or Shakespeare in literary circles? Not in my lifetime. My sincere question is, why write literary mud-puddles and expect oceans of understanding? Do I think that I have I arrived? Of course not. I'm still at the baby stages of communication skills. The real question for aspiring artists, in my opinion, is... am I still teachable? So the next book you read, listen closely for the heartbeat of the author and be amazed when you find your own matching rhythm. ...The old forms, the old molds broke, and sometimes the sentence which was being melted into shape burst forth and overflowed its boundaries, but in superb splashes, like rays of broken stars.

I think it will be an interesting class since while I've always been fascinated by Greek art (vase painting and whatnot) I really don't ""know"" too much about it. However, I have to say, after the first lecture, I'm not quite sure that the prof does either. Well, okay, that's not fair; she seems to be a legitimate scholar, got her MA in the Bronze Age Aegean, etc, so I don't want to write the class off right away. But I have to say that I found it pretty disconcerting during our first lecture today when she repeatedly referred to things that seem to me completely up in the air in concrete terms, and dismissed any notions to the contrary.  I guess I just kind of have a problem anyone referring to a society like that of the Minoans'--which, for all intents and purposes, is quite literally ""prehistoric""--in any concrete terms. I would have no problem at all with someone saying something like ""we THINK it's possible that given the prevalence of depictions of women in Minoan art, women had a much higher stance than elsewhere in the ancient world.""  But instead, it just kind of came off as her having this sort of new-age hippie slant on a society which, in reality, we don't KNOW very much about with any certainty; I think the prof is probably of the ""Gimbutas school"" regarding the happy pre-male-dominated prehistory... you know, back when the world was great! ;-). To me it seemed to be reading a bit too much into the available evidence at hand, and a bit disingenuous too, considering that most of the people in the room aren't going to be experts who can weigh the various sides of the argument and decide for themselves. (Naturally she dismissed any naysaying as misogynistic blasphemy).  I think it would be akin to me teaching a room full of freshmen students about Roman history and only giving them my personal leftist slant on it without giving them the contextual framework itself; but even then, this is at least historical, so they could check up on the written record if they wanted. Not so with the Bronze Age Aegean. Then again, maybe I'm just picky. It just seems to me that if something is less than certain, you shouldn't teach it as total fact. I'm also not sure about using things like fragmentary art as your sole source for these kind of assertions (women are depicted more than men--hence, they were obviously in charge); to me it's almost like claiming that dolphins used to be as big as boats because they are comparable in size with Minoan boats in a few frescoes.

72841,"This message has been flagged by multiple users and is no longer displayed (show)We thought you collectors might be interested in this little macabre exercise we have going. The question is: If you could steal a skull, any skull, whose would you choose, and why? Cranioklepty (the theft of skulls) has fallen out of fashion, but it wasnt very long ago that stealing skulls was viewed by some as akin to possessing genius. Colin Dickeys forthcoming CRANIOKLEPTY: GRAVE ROBBING AND THE SEARCH FOR GENIUS (Pub date: September 29, 2009) takes us on an extraordinary history of a peculiar kind of obsession. The after-death stories of Franz Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven, Emanuel Swedenborg, Sir Thomas Browne and many others have never before been told in such detail and vividness. Fully illustrated with some surprising images, this is a fascinating and authoritative history of ideas carried along on the guilty pleasures of real-after-life gothic tales. The desire to own the skulls of the famous, for study, for sale, for public (and private) display, seems to be instinctual and irresistible in some people. So we ask again, WHOSE SKULL WOULD YOU DIG? Send us your choiceby responding to this thread, leaving a comment on our profile page, or via email (craniokleptygmail.com) between September 9 and October 21, 2009. Well be posting the most lively ones (no pun intended) and as a thank you, well be sending a copy of CRANIOKLEPTY to the folks whose selections most intrigued us. Winners will be announced on October 31, 2009 (yes, on Halloween). For complete rules and regulations visit http://cranioklepty.com/pick-a-skull/rules-and-regulations/.

Isn't she the brilliant one to come sharing in the nick of time? I shelve my books alphabetically by author except for my Viragos, Persephones, and certain others that I like to keep all in one place. Like my classics, biographies, poetry, books on the same subject, ie the Civil War, WWI, WWII, etc. So I will go with my library set as is and have two columns running simultaneously. Most likely I will not read in any particular order; but will choose only one letter at a time until the entire alphabet has concluded. This could take me forever. I love it!~!

74105,"The master list. Some blurbs here but after 37, you can read on this thread to see what I thought. January 1. The Shack by William P. Young February 2. Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides- I think Eugenides writes the most beautiful and elegant prose I've ever read, hands-down. 3. Three Cups of Tea by Greg Mortensen- The story is great, the story telling is a little clunky. The story is good enough that I kept going. 4. Marley and Me by John Grogan 5. Ocean Star by Christina Dimari March 6. Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini 7. Salem's Lot by Stephen King April 8. Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri 9. The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway 10. The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde 11. Eclipse by Stephanie Meyer May 12. Run by Ann Patchett 13. Goodbye, Columbus by Philip Roth 14. The Handmaiden's Tale by Margaret Abbott 15. Duma Key by Stephen King June 16. Skinny Dip by Carl Hiaassen 17. A Movable Feast by Ernest Hemingway 18. The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand- I really enjoyed this one. It's a monster, but I was fascinated until about the halfway point. I think Rand is a little in your face about her metaphors, which take away the whole fun in metaphors in my opinion. She gets a little self-righteous and talkative by the end. Instead of letting Roark speak, she uses him as a platform to give her own speech to man kind in the final dramatic scene. I think this book could have been better with editing, but it's a classic, and I believe everyone could learn something from reading it. It was a great read, I just got a little worn out in the end. July 19. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins- I loved this book. I loved everything about it- the plot, the characters, the pace, the themes, the parallels with today's world. I can't wait to start the next one which comes out Sept 1st. Pick this one up in August, and you'll be done in plenty of time to read the sequel when it comes out. 20. Mother Night by Kurt Vonnegut- I flew through this mostly because Vonneguts wit and humor propel the story forward, along with the reader. It was good, not great (see Cat's Cradle) 21. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho- Loved this little fable. I flew through this one too. 22. Rules of Prey by John Sanford- I read this on the recommendation of my father, and I didn't love it. I thought the plot was predictable, and the main character didn't have much. I do plan to read another couple in the series because my dad loves them so I figure I owe them another couple tries. 23. Lucia, Lucia by Adriana Trigiani- I thought this book was just okay. I was very hopeful in the beginning since its set in the 1950s and stars a beautiful girl who sews beautiful clothes, but somewhere around the middle, this book turns into a tragedy with one disaster after another hitting Lucia, and I had to wonder what the point was- If any of you have read this and can tell me why you think the author had all of it happen, let me know. I just didn't get the overall point to this book, what bound it all together. Lucia getting to go on a date with her old sweetheart when she's 70/80 was not a consolation. 24. Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut- This is my favorite Vonnegut I've read (out of Galapapos, Mother Night, and Slaughter-House Five) I laughed out loud multiple times. the plot is crazy and it moves at a break-neck speed, which makes the book work. I would highly recommend this one. 25. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Steig Larsson (review posted below) 26. Running with the Demon by Terry Brooks August 27. On Writing by Stephen King 28. Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe 29. Peace Like a River by Leif Enger 30. Misery by Stephen King 31. My Life in France by Julia Child (review below) 32. The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman 33.

First things first, Cole hands her her birthday balloon that he had played with until it dragged the ground instead of floating up. Then after a quick 'Happy birthday', he demands to know what she plans on feeding him. Missie and Cole then reject all food that she offers so being a good Grandma she hops in her car, goes to Kroger's and buys food for them. Of course it has to be prepared and served. Next, after only eating about two bites, Cole dumps everyone of his toys onto the nice, clean living room floor. After cake, Missie spends several minutes rolling her eyes because grandma doesn't have the same VISION as she does when it comes to her Halloween costume. Theo may be the new kid on the block, but he won't be out done by his older siblings. He managed to explode out his diaper, front, back and leg holes while Grandma held him and mommy tried to find a towel and the diaper bag. After all this, I pack the kids into the truck and head home. It looked like Mom could go back to relaxing and begin her brand new book.

74796,"This message has been flagged by multiple users and is no longer displayed (show) Just finished reading In the Land of Cotton by Martha A. Taylor, a historical inter-racial romance. Have you ever wondered what were the children doing during the Civil Rights movement in the 50s and 60s? What were the people who weren't actively protesting or participating in racism doing? Author Martha A. Taylor recently published a book that answers these questions!  Martha tells her childhood story, in the book In The Land of Cotton, as a young white girl who has a memorable relationship with a spirit-filled black family. Martha meets a very poor family, the Boyds, and her life changes as she falls in love with one of the young members of the Boyd family, Silas. The book reads like a fiction Romance novel, but it is a long way from it! It takes a up close look at what being Black in the 50s was really like-- also poverty, family unity, racism, most importantly faith and loyalty. If you liked the movie and book, The Secret Life of Bees, you will truly love this new book by Martha A. Taylor! The story is spectacular and filled with historical revelations. For more details, read the material below to fully grasp the importance and relevance of this book, at this time. It is my favorite book of 2009! In the Land of Cotton by Martha A. Taylor  SLAVERY IS MORE THAN CHAINS AND SHACKLES SLAVERY IS A STATE OF MIND Immerse yourself in this highly anticipated political docu-drama set in the Deep South amidst the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement. Martha was a young white girl living in the Deep South, inundated with the racist sentiments of the times. But Martha's natural curiosity and generous heart led her to question this racial divide. Take the journey of a lifetime alongside Martha as she forges relationships that lead to self discovery and a clearer understanding of the world around her.  In the Land of Cotton provides an outstanding snapshot of life in the South during those troubled times - a snapshot everyone should take a close look at, regardless of era or color. The year was 1956. (Book info: ISBN-10: 1432734717; ISBN-13: 978-1432734718) BOOK REVIEW A wonderful mix of true life story and vivid history, June 5, 2009  By DelGal's Book Reviews   Martha Taylor expertly weaves a lovely, emotional, story that first intrigues the reader who glances at the synopsis, (thinking it is a fiction story) and learns about a girl who discovers a primitive black family living in the forest. Thus the story holds the reader's attention, who then comes to realize the truth throughout reading the entire story, and is hooked until the bittersweet ending. This is not only a tale about Martha and the lovely family that she discovers and her struggle to live through and understand racial inequality.  There is also extensive highlights of current events in our nation in the mid 50's to the 60's included in the story such as continued racial prejudice, Martin Luther King's strive towards equality and the Vietnam war. This story serves as an outstanding example of how America was still living with racial hatred and inequality, despite the positive efforts made to abolish slavery roughly a hundred years earlier.

75021,"Okay, I will have my review of Juliet, Naked posted soon...however, I really wanted to ask you what you thought of the ending. Maybe I'm just a bit thick, but I really felt like the ending was left a bit up in the air, or open to interpretation, if you will.  Personally, I got the feeling Annie was going to leave Gooleness and follow Tucker to America. This, of course, would be a disaster if it were true. The one thing I think I missed though is if Annie was pregnant or not. Clearly she wanted that to happen but Hornby didn't exactly come out an say her one-night-stand with Tucker was a success in the baby-making department. And if it was and Annie was going to America...YIKES! How on earth would that conversation go? I shudder at the thought. Yet this is what the ending of the book has led me to think about.  Please, did anyone have a different interpretation? Any other thoughts on this ending? I'd love to know what you think!!",no
75054,"I'm getting started late in the year but hopefully the thread will keep going after the end of 2009. Right now I am reading The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789 by Robert Middlekauf. It is a volume in the Oxford History of the United States. I have read two other volumes in the series this year, Battle Cry of Freedom and What Hath God Wrought. They are all very well written and thoroughly researched. I am about one-half way through this volume and even though I thought I knew something about the topic I have learned a lot. The first half of the book has been about the events that led up to the Declaration of Independence. I was surprised how much the events so far follow the pattern of most political revolutions. It started with the Parliament passing the Stamp Act, this angered a group of Americans who told Parliament ""no taxation without representation"". Then the British repealed The Stamp Act and passed the Revenue Act and the Suspending Act.  The Boston Tea Party really angered the British and they closed down the port of Boston. The dispute began with a minority on each side pressing the conflict. On the American side the rabble rousers goaded the British and then the British reaction made more Americans angry. Slowly the conflict escalated until finally the Americans wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Revolutionary War started.    ",no

My personal favourites would be Juliet Stevenson and Lindsay Duncan (English actresses, very well thought of) who have fairly neutral voices. I don't want to be reminded too much who I'm listening to. Hannah Gordon, for example, has a very ""good"" voice but is somehow instantly identifiable as Hannah Gordon. For men, I think Robert Powell would be pretty good. Simon Callow would be too Simon Callow.

Anyways - I do have a couple questions though - Why wasn't any of Harry Potter series listed? I know for a fact that it has been banned at so many schools and libraries, including churches. Is it because there's no ""direct source""? I *think* Twilight saga has been banned in several schools because of vampirism (is that even a word?!).

For example, I have the original book stated as a memoir, yet you won't find it anywhere else), another book comes in mind is How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got A Life: A Novel, as it has been labeled plagiarized, therefore, banned at libraries, schools, etc. I'm looking over the list, and I'm so sure that there's a LOT more than what I see, and many banned books that I remember are children's book because for heaven forbid that we're going to dirty the minds of precious innocent children with reading!",no

It won't dent my TBR pile at all and I'll still probably buy way more books this year than I'll read, but it's an attempt to start annilating that notorious unread pile of books at the foot of my bed and in front of my bookshelves and filling my bookshelves and covering the kitchen table...

And so, my list of goodies published this year that I hope the Jolly One puts under our Chanukah bush (yeah, my wifes Jewish and hates the consumerism, but I give her lots of books and she forgets her upsetitude). I decided to focus on those works published in the last year, not only because that is the tradition of such lists, but I figured the dead authors who might have made the cut dont really need the sales (although frankly, I dont think many of the deceased wouldve, but thats another rant entirely). Its over-long, and highlights a few things Ive already read from this year, but in the spirit of casting a big SFF safety-net (considering all the SFF authors out there who are struggling to make rent or pay their medical bills), I absolve myself of guilt. In no particular order: Sandman Slim (by Richard Kadrey) Yellow Blue Tibia Last Dragon Finch The Windup Girl Julian Comstock Palimpsest Open Your Eyes The Lord of the Sands of Time Mercury Station The Accord Green Moxyland The Devil's Alphabet Escape From Hell! End of the Century Black Blood Norse Code Total Oblivion, More or Less Heart of Veridon The Sad Tale of the Brothers Grossbart The Ressurectionist (by Jack O'Connell) The Quiet War Mind Over Ship Shambling Towards Hiroshima Hylozoic The Painting and the City You Might Sleep Red Claw The Alchemy of Stone Eclipse 3 I believe all these titles were published in 09 although a few 08s may have slipped through. There seems to be a preponderance of fantasy or quasi-fantasy titles here through no intention of my own. I tend to be more of a science fiction fan, but there were just more interesting fantasy titles this year (subjectively speaking, of course. So goes the market I suppose).  -edited to add in author info from the broken touchstones ",no

This year, I've decided to list the books I read each week and to write down brief - or not so brief - impressions of them. It may produce some book talk or it may be just a new way of cataloguing my reading life.

7972,"Getting Started LibraryThing (LT) is not just about storing your catalog/bibliography, but also about sharing information about books.  For example 
 Seeing some other guild/circle member has a book you are interested in, you can ask to take it to a meeting to have a look.
Find online reviews and discussions, collect/discuss possible errata.
 In mailgroups as for example Arachne it is difficult to locate/trace an old discussion on a book in the mail archive. In LT books are linked to discussions through the touchstone mechanism. The more lace makers and collectors join and add their books, the better it becomes. This thread is not intended as a help page. It just collects some information scattered arround the site and gears it towards lacemakers new to LT. For more help see the home page and about page (take the tour) and browse through the less formal groups as FYI, combiners, bug collectors and Recommend Site Improvements Consequences of sharing book information Information about books can only be gathered automatically if titles and authors are written identically in all catalogs. Spelling variants in titles (like The Torchon lace workbook) or translations (like Honiton lace patterns) or incomplete author names or married names (like Ulrike Voelcker-Lhr) can be combined manually into works. The supposedly correct title (an educated guess by LT) is shown at the top of the page, the variants under ""other copies and editions"". An author page has ""also known as"" links to the variants and contains also the books catalogued with the variants. Fill your catalog LT trusts manually imported books less when it has to make educated guesses, so it strongly reccommends import via libraries. You have to select the library to import from. The Library of Congress (LC), or Amazon (frequently crappy data but might provide book covers) seem the best choices.  Upload your old catalog The LT import form picks all the ISBN's from your list and searches the library of your choice. Get the failures from the error report and try another library. Note also that a spreadsheet might have swallowed the leading zero's of ISBN's. Check in advance if all your ISBN's have 10 digits (13 as of january 2007) and repair if necesarry. Once the basic description of your books are in your catalog, you can sort LT catalog the same way as your own list, and book by book you can drag your tags/comments from your old list to LT. Well, first you'll have to double click the cell were you want to drag into. Books of your old catalog without ISBN's Drag the title/author or whatever from your list to the LT add form. LT doesn't find the book in any library? Try WorldCat. Unfortunately LT has no import connection with WC and will never get one due to conflicting interests. So open WC in a 3rd window. Drag from your catalog to the WC search field, then drag from WC to the LT maual form and drag the tags/comment/review from your list to LT. You might notice not the text but URL's are copied: Select a larger chunck to the comment field, then drag the portions to the individual fields. If the book has no ISBN you might also want to drag the WC permanent link to the comment field to replace the otherwise automagic ""find in a library"" link. No personal catalog yet? The LT add form is reccommend, you'll have to type to search, or buy a bar-code scanner. If LT doesn't find your book in a library, try the WorldCat procedure described above. If you are lazy and willing to bear the shame and trouble of duplicating mistakes by others there is another way. Select the catalog of another lace maker or collector, and click the big green plus for the books you want to have in your catalog, use the back button of your browser for the next one. Commas authors and tags Commas have special meaning in various catalog fields. For the primary author it separates the last name (which should be entered first) from the first name. The other authors should be entered first name first and the comma now separates authors, not name parts. For the tags the comma also has a special separating meaning. Check your tag pages to see the effect. More hints on tags in the thread sort. Languages It is delightful to see that Honiton lace patterns shows the English title when the URL contains .com, but shows the Dutch title when the URL contains .nl. But Thread and Pricking: A Partnership allways shows the German title. Probably because LT trusts the manually imported English copy less than the German copy imported from amazon. The English copy also doesn't specify German as original language. I don't know yet what happens when both the copy in the original language and the translated copy are imported manually. I do hope however, you understand it is important to pay attention to the language fields. Note there is also a ""language"" called Multiple Languages. Corrected some spelling errors kindly explained to me. Gave more stress on the crappy Amazon data. I combined about half a dozen of ""my"" authors and books, usually caused by incorrect Amazon input. Added a link to a bar-code scanner.",no

79980,"Geneg raised this idea in the Translation thread. I think it's very interesting and warrants a wider discussion. Why is English so poorly inflected and other languages are more heavily so. Does the lack of inflection (mostly) make English leaner and more flexible, or does it hinder it in some way. I took a minor in classical Greek in college so I'm familiar with inflection and how it dictates word and sentence construction and so on. Of course English uses inflections for verb tenses, but beyond that, well, not so much.  Is it an advantage, a disadvantage, or advantage neutral, to speak an inflected language? Why is English so poorly inflected? Note from Murr: inflections are the bits added on to verbs and nouns to show gender, time, number, relationship and so on, such as -o and -a endings in Italian, all those whacky noun endings you have to remember in German, and the endings of French verbs that tortured us at school.",no

I advise sitting so that you are about head high to the middle of the screen in viewing if possible- I was looking down a bit.

Pretty heavy handed obvious comparisons between the aliens and the disenfranchised people of earth but not in a overbearing manner IMOHO.

It was about a space empire centered on Earth as the ruthless homeworld that had colonies which were trying to get out from under its iron grip. Earth developed special soldiers that went through a surgical process where they implanted a mesh under the soldiers skin that allowed them to become ghost-like. They could walk through walls, were immune (more or less) to normal weapons (I think I remember that right) but the process was almost like dying, and many soldiers died in training. The hero was a soldier who fell in love with his trainer, he eventually broke free of their grip and I remember him flying to one of the rebel planets. Earth's most deadly weapon was a hellbore bomb that could destroy whole planets, there was also in the book a description of how a mining colony would launch payloads of mined minerals into space and there would be whole chains of these payloads flying to the processing destination.

80473,"Im looking forward to doing this 50 Book Challenge, I came across this group around September last year and began a challenge to see how many books I could read in three months. I enjoyed doing the challenge but stopped posting how I was doing about two weeks before the end of the year, I think I read about seventeen books altogether from September to December. I think I did quite well in all fairness, but not as well as I would have liked. Although the general target to reach is fifty books, I would like to read as many as possible, Id say that I could reach seventy-five books altogether by the next New Year, but I would like to reach one-hundred...at least. But now this is a new 50 Book Challenge, a New Year and I have new books to read. In this years 50 Book Challenge I will be posting at least one message on here each day to inform of how well Im doing and how Im progressing in the books Im reading. I will list my books like such: Book 1# The Stand by Stephen King. Every book that I read this year will be posted in a thread. Every book I read, mentioned or refer to in a post will be touchstoned which you may have noticed. In my 2010 50 Book Challenge (this one) all the books I read I will categorise in the 2010 50 Book Challenge section of my library so they will all be listed for me to refer to and other members to see. I havent got any certain plan of how Im going to read my books but I plan to read a few Stephen Kings this year, I have several of them in my possession: 'salems Lot by Stephen King. Cell by Stephen King. Cujo by Stephen King. It by Stephen King. Song of Susannah by Stephen King. The Bachman Books by Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by Stephen King. The Stand by Stephen King. The Talisman by Stephen King and Peter Straub I have already read 'salems Lot and It, so I have four months worth of Stephen King books to read. Four because I cannot read Song of Susannah as it is the sixth volume of The Dark Tower series, which has five volumes before it, therefore in order to understand Song of Susannah I must read all the other volumes. I have read volume one already (The Gunslinger) so I only have volumes two-to-five to get through then maybe I can read the final instalment The Dark Tower. Hednesford library, my local library, has a fair few Stephen King books so I can just pop round the corner if I wish to read one. I think they have Liseys Story, Black House, Wolves of the Calla, The Dark Tower and some others.  Although it may seem this way, I am not going to be reading just Stephen King books. No, I will be reading all sorts of books, I read pretty much any book going, and I read lots of various books from many different authors. In my personal library I have about thirty books that Ive yet to read and plan to read by the end of this 50 Book Challenge. Im sure by now that if youre reading this post on my challenge that youre tired of my lists, but you dont have to read it Im just keeping it here for personal reference (I will be striking out the books below as I read them): 1)	Insomnia by Stephen King. 2)	Duma Key by Stephen King. 3)	Carrie by Stephen King. 4)	The Stand by Stephen King. 5)	Cell by Stephen King. 6)	The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by Stephen King. 7)	Cujo by Stephen King. 8)	Song of Susannah by Stephen King. 9)	The Talisman by Stephen King and Peter Straub. 10)	The Bachman Books by Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman. a.	The Long Walk. b.	Roadwork. c.	The Running Man. 11)	Haunted by James Herbert. 12)	The Spear by James Herbert. 13)	The Magic Cottage by James Herbert. 14)	Creed by James Herbert. 15)	The Fog by James Herbert. 16)	Moon by James Herbert. 17)	Hannibal Rising by Thomas Harris. 18)	The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. 19)	Kiss the Girls by James Patterson. 20)	The 5th Horseman by James Patterson. 21)	Run For Your Life by James Patterson. 22)	Beach Road by James Patterson. 23)	BloodBorn by Kathryn Fox. 24)	The Narrows by Michael Connelly. 25)	Echo Park by Michael Connelly. 26)	Whispers of Betrayal by Michael Dobbs. 27)	The Lords Day by Michael Dobbs. 28)	Death of a Blue Movie Star by Jeffery Deaver. 29)	Mistress of Justice by Jeffery Deaver. 30)	The Broken Window by Jeffery Deaver. 31)	Skin and Blister by Victoria Blake. 32)	Digital Fortress by Dan Brown. 33)	Deception Point by Dan Brown. 34)	The Bad Place by Dean Koontz. 35)	Life Expectancy by Dean Koontz. 36)	Dark Rivers of the Heart by Dean Koontz. 37)	Second Violin by John Lawton. 38)	Old Flames by John Lawton. 39)	The Fighter by Craig Davidson. 40)	To the Bright and Shining Sun by James Lee Burke. 41)	The Seventh Scroll by Wilbur Smith. 42)	Warlock by Wilbur Smith. 43)	The Wildfire Season by Andrew Pyper. 44)	Mauras Game by Martina Cole. 45)	The Jump by Martina Cole. 46)	Code to Zero by Ken Follett. 47)	The Sign by Raymond Khoury. It does seem like a lot but Ill read all of those without much trouble before the end of the year. Some of them I cant wait to get stuck into, there are others that I dont really want to even touch but Im going to read them all anyway. I plan to read at least two books per week, which is easily done if I read at a good pace, but I think there are certain books in the above list that may only be able to be read in a long amount of time, like The Stand for example; the edition that I have is 1325 pages long, if I read one-hundred pages each day Ill get through it easily in two weeks, if I do one-hundred and twenty-five pages per day Ill do it in approx ten days. If I aim for one-hundred and fifty Ill get close to about eight days. But, reading two-hundred in one day I shall read the entire thing in just under seven days, sounds simple enough to me. So just to get it out of the way I think I will read: Book 1# The Stand by Stephen King. Just so it doesnt slow down my reading for the rest of the year. For some reason I just think that Im not going to enjoy reading this, I enjoyed It, which was about as long, but it dragged me down a bit. I dont want to be reading about the same characters for ages, as Im aware The Stand has mannnnnny characters. However, The Stand is split into three books; all contained in the same book, so its sort of like an omnibus but still the same book: Book I: Captain Trips. (466 pages) Book II: On the Border. (596 pages) Book III: The Stand. (265 pages) So if I get tired of The Stand I could finish at the end of Book I: Captain Trips, then read another book, and then read Book II: On the Border, then read a different book, then after Ive finished that one Id finish off The Stand with Book III: The Stand. I dont know if that would speed me up or slow me down but it sounds like it gives me an easier read, but if I can really get stuck into it, I reckon I would be able to crack down on it in less than a week. Ive posted this thread pretty early, Im starting The Stand on New Years Day. Oh, and sorry the message was so long, the rest of the messages wont be this long. Hope you all have a good New Year and good luck to your 50 Book Challenges this year. ",no

80500,"jfetting ~ Thanks so for inviting me to the new Group! Hi, and Happy New Year One and All! This year I'm going to be revising the draft of a novel I wrote for NaNoWriMo in 2007 in the hopes of getting it published (8/29/10 ETA hahahahahaha that goal didn't last long.), so I don't plan on doing as much reading as usual. Nevertheless, being an Eternal Optimist, I've decided to keep track here in the 100-Book Challenge Group anyway.    ETA my criteria for rating what I read. To get a 3.5 out of 5 star rating or higher, the book must be well-written (or at least not badly written), be compelling (or at least interesting), have well-defined, multi-layer characters or a really good plot, and ultimately be a satisfying read. I don't usually finish books that don't meet those criteria, unless they are for a book club, they are a classic that I'm reading to broaden my reading horizons or some similar reason. That's why you won't see any (or at least almost no) ratings below a 3/5.",no

80733,"Hello once more, ev'rybody! In 2007 (http://www.librarything.com/topic/13443) I read 79 books; in 2008 (http://www.librarything.com/topic/26777) I read 100 books; and in 2009 (http://www.librarything.com/topic/54562) I read 165 books. The real question now is, what does 2010 have in store? This is the year I'll finish out my undergraduate studies and then either begin graduate studies or else take a year to pursue government-funded research in the Philippines; I await the committee's decision. The amount of book-readin' I'll get done this year is, of course, directly contingent upon how that turns out, to say nothing of next year. So, I'll begin with the goal of 100, relatively modest compared to the exploits of the past year. Fortunately, I'm able to begin with a bit of initial oomph. Just this morning, I completed The Ideology of Religious Studies by Timothy Fitzgerald. My yearly total stands at... 1.

80809,"Happy New Year! And here we go again! I reached my goal of 50 for the first time in 2009 so I'm hoping for a repeat this year. I decided to make a few changes to the way I organize my thread this time around. I'll be keeping a running list of my books here in this first post as a quick reference. My reviews will have ratings with them this time (I don't know why I never included them before since I always had to give a star rating when cross-posting to Amazon anyway) and will include anything of note like awards the book has won. I'd also like to include my favourite passages more consistently than I did last year.  I only have a couple of goals for my reading this year:  a) Read more books from my own library! The stack has been steadily growing while I keep borrowing from the public library and reading those books instead. So, I want to cut down that pile and be able to post proper LT reviews for books in my actual catalogue. b) This will be the year of the reread. Inspired by Bonnie (bonniebooks), I'd like to make time to reread my favourites and/or read something by one of my favourite authors that I haven't read yet.    The first book of 2010 will be The Book of Negroes by Lawrence Hill, which I have been waiting a year and a half to get to and which has been, so far, worth the wait.

80845,It's 2010? Crazy. I ended 2009 reading 54 book ... I am going to aim for (a realistic) 50 again for 2010.  I am not going to set any books that I want to read for this year (although I do have a list of ones I would like to read)- I am just going to read what I feel like. Last year I tried to get myself to have ever other book I read be a classic... which was great in theory but it didn't really go as planned. So I am going to let this year just go with the flow.  Obsidian Butterfly by Laurell K. Hamilton I didn't love this series at first- I had read 1 book from this series- but now I am hooked.

81271,"Picking up from last year's list (http://www.librarything.com/topic/44867), here's my first book for the new year: 1 - The Forty Rules of Love: A Novel of Rumi by Elif Shafak Not the book I was hoping it would be. I was interested in learning more about Rumi, but this book was much more about his friend Shams of Tabriz than about the poet himself. Worse, it was overlaid with a contemporary love story that failed to deepen the history. The love story seemed pasted on top, and I didn't believe the contemporary protagonist Ell; mostly she was under-written. I could understand her leaving her husband, but not her children. But I don't recall her considering them in making her decision. On top of this (and perhaps it's a case of English not being the author's mother-tongue), there was no difference in between the language of the contemporary characters and those of the 13th century. As well, there was little in the way of character differentiation from character to character; everyone speaks the same, feels the same. Sure, some are good and some are evil, and they have their own point of view, but if an author is going to write from constantly shifting first person perspective, I'd like to be able to feel it's a different person speaking without the help of the chapter titles. Finally, an almost complete lack of humour or wit, and this wasn't the book for me. Probably means it will be a bestseller when it's published in February.",no

This exposed a weakness in my book-reading habits that I'm not happy with. Time is being wasted on books read by accident.

81402,"Whether you read for school, for your own enjoyment, for studies, or out of sheer curiosity, we've all come across books that seemed like a good idea at the time. What history-related books have you read that you would never recommend to anyone? Malintzin's Choices by Camilla Townsend It was an assigned book for my Colonial Biographies class at college, otherwise I never would've picked it up. It reads like historical fiction and isn't in my taste range at all. But that's not why I dislike it, in fact, my entire class didn't approve of it. The author spends much too long talking about the environment around the characters (birds, trees, weather), that one struggles to follow the actual narrative. And the moment you find the story, you're lost again in filler inner dialogue. Needless to say, I recommended to my professor that she choose another book for her next class. The Life and Times of Thomas Jefferson by Thomas E. Watson I read this one for a comparative book review (the other one being Merrill Peterson's amazing Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation) This book can be considered ""out-of-date"", and would lead some to think that ""well, no wonder you wouldn't recommend it."" But ah, there are plenty of old biographies that I've read that do just fine for a secondary source. So I gave this one a fair chance. The first chapter quickly summarizes Jefferson's childhood and graduation from the College of William and Mary, but for the next two chapters the reader is given a history lesson of the American Revolution. Jefferson makes a fleeting appearance every now and then, but is never involved at all at what is being described. For example, after an exciting depiction of the Battle of New Orleans, Jefferson is dedicated one line of text, as being too ""deep in the classics, and in love-passages with Rebecca Burwell"" to be properly discussed at this time. The whole of Chapter 11 is dedicated to Patrick Henry with a following chapter on the entire presidential career of George Washington. Jefferson is hardly mentioned here as well. Basically, he strays too far from his subject and lacks an explanation for names through the descriptions of certain events. Also the author blatantly refuses to acknowledge Jefferson as a Deist, although Jefferson proclaimed himself as such. He instead classifies Jefferson as Unitarian; but could not have been Unitarian because Jefferson rejected the idea of revelation (The Jefferson Bible). And forget any mention of Sally Hemmings. To put it simply, ""Sally who?"" There's plenty others I have, but that's what I'll offer so far. What are your least favorite history books?",yes

Eating right for one day to get to your weekly target weight sounds foreign to me. I do recognize that he is speaking to the majority of the population, those who cannot stick to a rigid plan. The beginning of the book talks about how it is OK to eat your normal diet (The SAD diet), and then by having a 'fat' day, you can eat fruit, veggies, nuts, seeds & water as well as exercising for 1 hour and lose a lb. a week. Where this may work, it is not healthy. Toward the end of his book he emphasizes more on eating healthy. His logic is that if you start slow, you will eventually eat better more continuously.

81671,"Harmonies of the net by Jane S. Fancher My review is  Here A well thought out conclusion to what isn't the end of the series! We get to see the deepest and darkest parts of Stephens' upbringing, and the misunderstandings the Wesley especially can make in interpreting other's actions. Gripping - if at times disturbing - stuff. The report is sent. For all the good it will do. And while Loren Cantrell wraps a few matters up - including some last ditch efforts to heal Homi - Stephen is released to the planet for a few days RnR. Much to the displeasure of the Recon advisor Lexi who wasn't consulted and would have stridently rejected such a course of action, believeing Stephen far too traumatised from being subjected to Cocheta input, to cope with much more stress. However as Lexi herself allowed Stephen to end up in that situation against her Admiral's orders, she finds herself in disfavour - or at least percieves that to be the case. As with all of Jane's work that I've read so far, it is the character's individual perceptions that really stand out as great writing, and enable a lot of empathy - even with conflicting viewpoints. Meanwhile the NetAt have responded to the report with a high priority embassy come to take Stephen back into the fold. As it turns out they'v e been classmates with most of the principle characters, and as NetAT they are used to having absolute command in pretty much all circumstances. Loren however quickly refutes that notion, leaving them to spread their disgruntlement as they can. For Spacers they deal with planetside remarkably well however. This however proves to be the straw on the camel that is Stephen's back, and he flees - as he later explains due to the Cocheta's sense of Preservation. What you are left with is a fascinating insight into feeling and coping with the circumstances of when and if non-physical aliens are real. The artifacts are indesputable, but what is real to Stephen doesn't meet Wesley's standards, real, unreal, mad and sane. Who are you to make the judgement - even if the stability of mankind's expansion depends upon it.  Superb, read them all, and cry shame on the publishers who abandoned it.

81969,"Hello all; Just checking in to let you know the good times just keep rolling here at the Hull-Pendergrass estate............................. 3 days after my father in law's memorial service, (which was just perfect; it could not have been done any better than Pa's kids did it), I spent the entire day in E.R. with my mother. She had spent from 3:00 in the morning until 11:30 when I arrived attempting to get out of bed. She wears one of those ""I have fallen and can't get up"" buttons, but this is the 3rd time she has needed to use it and has forgotten all about it. She was so very weak, in such pain and dehydrated. She had some cartilage behind her knee that had hooked or snagged on a ligament or tendon. Once they were able to find out what it was and break it loose, she was fairly pain free; just very fatigued and sore. She is agreeable now that at 91 years of age, she should no longer live alone. We would like for her to come and stay with us until she decides where she wants to settle, but she is dragging her feet. Mother does not like children or pets. So I am is spending most of the time I am not doing child care, down at my mother's. And the good times just keep rolling........... Saturday after watching our lab, (who turned 1 Thanksgiving), take forever to get up and then hop on her hind feet, we took her to the Veterinary Animal Hospital. And yes, even at just 1 yr of age, she has hip dysplasia and her knee joints are extremely inflamed. $10,000.00 in U.S.D. for the hip replacements; the vet opted for medical intervention and then perhaps surgery to remove the top of the ball of her hip joint, if necessary. Dear hubby and the Dr. Fay, (who also has a yellow lab and has been Abby's vet since birth), were all in tears. So she gets a shot every Wed. and Sat. and three medications daily. She is not so crazy about the fish oil that we must put on her food and has stopped eating. We figure that when she gets hungry enough, she will eat it. It is strange. One day she was getting up and moving fine and within 3 days she was at the Vet's. Our vet says that usually when they are that young and develop this, it does come on rather quickly. She is better already. AND NOW THE GOOD TIMES ARE REALLY ROLLING.............................................. On a lighter note; I am now a Great grandmother.

""with all his host/Of the rebel Angels"".

82379," I originally posted in the thread Recommended Site Improvements: List your top 5 small improvements!. It's to address a bug, at least in Firefox, where if you click the Touchstones they never display a link and the Javascript action that should show a hidden div just shows and hides some whitespace. This fix doesn't need a plugin, you just need to modify your custom stylesheet in firefox. I found a good description, Per-site custom CSS in Firefox, of how to do this for windows and Mac. Linux users will want to look in ~/.mozilla for the steps to work. The post walks you through modifying the user stylesheet for any site so you can have your styles override the sites.  What you'll want to put in this file (you may need to create it) is something like the following... @-moz-document domain(librarything.com) { div.touchstones div.pick div.hidden {  visibility:visible !important;  } } At least for me when that code is there in my userContent.css file, I see the touchstones like normal. However, when I click on them they expand and I see two links. Highlighting doesn't seem to work for me, but the other is a simple work id url. you can click or right click on that. I'm guessing this is just something wonky with the initial starting state of the javascript + css. I've had similar things happen in my own code. I think I remember some issue if a div is set to be visiblity: hidden at page load, Firefox doesn't render enough space for it in the page. So you have to have it visible, but hide it via javascript, which might cause blinking for some users if connection is slow. Don't know if I'm remembering correctly. ",no

What we as citizens have failed to realize is that the campaign does not allow for certain details to be brought into light without specific probing. Our president never lied about his stance, the campaign just painted a slightly more liberal view of him than is reality.) 2) My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult (I have not watched the movie yet and do intend to at some point. As for the book, though, I found it to have too many sub plots until the very end when she managed to tie it all together. Over all I loved it.) 3) The Kite Runner by Khaled Hoseini (I couldn't stop crying the entire time I was going through this book. I thought some passages could have been crafted slightly better but for a fairly new author from another country I thought it was very well written. It is one of my favorites.) 4) The Woman Who Can't Forget by Jill Price (This book had me thoroughly fascinated and I learned a lot from it, especially since I deal with my own memory troubles.

83376,"I once got involved in a ferocious Internet argument about Lily Dale. In a few words, somebody was claiming that Lily Dale isn't a realistic character, but male fantasy. That is, from the point of view of the unreconstructed male, she's a portrayal of how we'd like a woman to behave, or how we think a woman ought to behave. Interestingly, the person I was debating with was male, as am I. (Well, I think he was, but you never can be totally sure of these things on the Internet, can you?) I'd be interested to know what other people think. There is a relevant passage in Trollope's Autobiography on the subject. In case you haven't read it, here it is (By the way, why 'French' prig, I wonder? Did Trollope differentiate between French and English prigs?): The Small House at Allington redeemed my reputation with the spirited proprietor of the Cornhill, which must, I should think, have been damaged by Brown, Jones, and Robinson. In it appeared Lily Dale, one of the characters which readers of my novels have liked the best. In the love with which she has been greeted I have hardly joined with much enthusiasm, feeling that she is somewhat of a French prig. She became first engaged to a snob, who jilted her; and then, though in truth she loved another man who was hardly good enough, she could not extricate herself sufficiently from the collapse of her first great misfortune to be able to make up her mind to be the wife of one whom, though she loved him, she did not altogether reverence. Prig as she was, she made her way into the hearts of many readers, both young and old; so that, from that time to this, I have been continually honoured with letters, the purport of which has always been to beg me to marry Lily Dale to Johnny Eames. Had I done so, however, Lily would never have so endeared herself to these people as to induce them to write letters to the author concerning her fate.

I also think that the cover had the summit of a mountain on it with a river of spirits spiraling upwards. The main plot of the story was the defeating of a river spirit/god that was much like the river Styx. Departed souls would travel this river to a mountain where they would be taken to the afterlife. The river was malicious, as anyone/thing that was in or traveling on the river would slowly be drained of their life. There were spirits for other things, and could be held in weapons (one of the protagonists used a sword that had a bird's spirit in him. The bird spoke to him through the sword and granted him increased strength and abilities as well as tactical information in battle) or ""merged"" with a person's spirit to enable them to summon that spirit later on.  The main female character was at some tribal-like function, close to a third of the way through the book, and traveled into the spirit world via tapping on a drum after pricking her finger open.

His message that men just don't have the emotional things that women want, and that we should all just get used to it......is a great disservice to our culture.

8650,"One of the most unjustly neglected writers in the field of history and politics is Thomas Babbington Macaulay. If you own nothing by him, go immediately to Amazon, or better yet your local used bookshop, and buy anything by him you can find. He should be in the library of every conservative and libertarian. Trust me on this. Start with a collection of his Essays, if you can find them. If nothing else, you will see a polemical style from which you can learn. If you can find his Essays, read his polemic ""On the Political Disabilities of the Jews,"" written in 1831, when it was proposed to grant full civil rights to the Jews of England, who, until that time, like Catholics earlier, had not been allowed to vote or hold political office. His argument is aimed at Conservative opponents of this measure, who argued, among other things, that Jews could never really be loyal Englishmen, and that their higher loyalty would always be to their co-religionists abroad. (He himself was a Whig -- American conservatism is more Whig than old-world Conservative, and both conservatives and libertarians today will recognize him as one of ours.) Macaulay argued that a group of people will become patriotic and loyal to their national government to the extent that they are treated well by it. I am not trying to apply that argument to the case of European (and American) Muslims today. Although I think it still has force, many things have changed, and the situation is more complex. I do not believe we understand very well -- yet -- what is happening within world Islam, and what to do about it.  However, I have been disturbed to see otherwise-thoughtful conservatives beginning to move in what I believe is a very dangerous political direction: perhaps under the impact of the disappointment caused by our problems in Iraq, there seems to be a tendency to abandon the attempt to win the Muslim masses away from the influence of the jihadis.  In effect, this outlook agrees with Bin Laden that his doctrines are indeed the natural expression of Islam and that the ""Bush Doctrine"" is an impossible undertaking.  Except for making Noam Chomskey President and unilaterally disarming, we could not adopt a more disastrous course. I cite Macaulay because he makes a point very eloquently which I think applies fully to those who look into the Quran, find various bloodthirsty passages in it, and then deduce directly from their existence, that Muslims must be suspect, given that they are enjoined to believe that the Quran is the unmediated word of God. In this essay Macaulay wrote: ""It is altogether impossible to reason from the opinions which a man professes to his feelings and his actions; and in fact no person is ever such a fool as to reason thus, except when he wants a pretext for persecuting his neighbors. A Christian is commanded, under the strongest sanctions to be just in all his dealings. Yet to how many of the twenty-four millions of professing Christians in these islands would any in his senses lend a thousand pounds without security? A man who should act, for one day, on the supposition that all the people about him were influenced by the religion which they professed, would find himself ruined before night: and no man ever does act on that supposition in any of the ordinary concerns of life, in borrowing, in lending, in buying or in selling. But when any of our fellow-creatures are to be oppressed, the case is different. Then we represent these motives which were know to be so feeble for good, as omnimpotent for evil. Then we lay to the charge of our victims all the vices and follies to which their doctrines, however remotely, seem to tend. We forget that the same weakness, the same laxity, the same disposition to prefer the present to the future, which make men worse than a good religion, make them better than a bad one. ""It was in this way that our ancestors reasoned, and that some people in our time still reason, about the Catholics. A Papist believes himself bound to obey the Pope. The Pope has issued a bull deposing Queen Elizabeth. Therefore every Papist will treat Her Grace an an usurper. Therefore every Papist is a traitor. Therefore every Papist ought to be hanged, drawn and quartered. To this logic we owe some of the most hateful laws that have ever disgraced our history. Surely the answer lies on the surface. The Church of Rome may have commanded these men to treat the queen as an usurper. But she has commanded them to do many other things which they have never done. She enjoins her priests to observe strict purity. You are always taunting them with their licentiousness. She commands all her followers to fast often, to be charitable to the poor, to take no interest for money, to fight no duels, to see no plays. Do they obey these injunctions? If it be that very few of them strictly observe her precepts, when her precepts are opposed to their passions and interests, may not loyalty, may not humanity, may not the love of ease, may not the fear of death, be sufficient to prevent them from executing those wicked orders which the Church of Rome has issued against the sovereign of England? When we know that many of these people do not care enough for their religion to go without beef on a Friday for it, why should we think they will run the risk of being racked and hanged for it? ""People are now reasoning about the Jews as our fathers reasoned about the Papists."" ---------------------------------------------- Please do not get me wrong. I think that mass Muslim immigration to Europe is a serious problem. I am perfectly aware that it only takes a few crazed religious zealots to wreak havoc in a civilized country. I follow closely all the alarming opinion polls showing that many young British Muslims (where I live) incline to one degree or another to sympathy with their co-religionists engaged in war with us.  But precisely because we have a serious problem on our hands, we must be very careful not to fall into the trap of consigning, without a fight, many millions of recruits to our enemies, just because they ""believe in the Quran"".",no

""There once was a boy named Lucien that longed so much for greener pastures. He liked to skateboard, play music and eat the finest fried chicken in the land... but he didn't have anybody to eat such delicious fried chicken with. He was a little bit lonely to say the least. Little did he know that everything was going to change. One day whilst skateboarding through the park he swerved to avoid a girl who was very wobbly on a bike. Unfortunately he managed to fall off his skateboard at the same time. The girl on the wobbly bike ran over to see whether he was hurt. And when he looked up... not only was she beautiful but she was also stuffing her face with the finest brand of fried chicken known to MAN! He was in love! And together they cycled and skateboarded in the sunshine.

87982,"There's a general thread on books in the Ancient History Group. I think it's time for one in this group. I'll start by recommending Chris Wickham's The Inheritance of Rome. I haven't had time to write a full review but will get to that eventually. This book provides something of an overview/synthesis of the evolution of Medieval Culture from 400-1000. It's generally focused on Western Europe but does have some information on the Balkans and Islam. What Wickham does is look at various social structures - frex, landholding - and track how each evolved, in different areas, over the time period. I wouldn't recomment it to anyone as his or her first book on the period because it's not really a narrative history, though some of that's included. For a more narrative history try Matthew Innes' An Introduction to Early Medieval Europe which is much more of a chronological narrative. Wickham is more of a ""tie it all together"" sort of book for someone who's read some on the Merovingians, some on the Carolingians, some on the Lombards, etc and is interested in how society evolved - not who fought what battle when.  Here's the bad: No footnotes and no bibliography. The book does have a list of sources by page in the back so you can find the sources but it's a lot harder to get there than if it had footnotes.

88114,"9 Dragons by Michael Connelly is the latest installment in a series of novels focusing on Detective Hieronymus ""Harry"" Bosch of the LAPD. There's a shooting that may involve a Hong Kong triad, a reluctant partner, a detective from the Asian Gang Unit that Harry's not sure he can trust. That's just a typical day for a fictional detective, until the case strikes close to home: Harry's teenage daughter, Maddie, goes missing and he receives a video from her kidnappers. She is clearly in danger and there's every indication that it is tied to the Triad shooting. Harry is on the next plane to Hong Kong and he intends to bring his daughter back, no matter what. I am a big fan of detective novels, and I love a good series -- you get a chance to get to know the characters, to see them succeed (or fail) and to see what happens in their lives. Harry Bosch is a great example. We've seen him through various ups and downs during his time with the LAPD (IAD investigations, transfers from Robbery Homicide to the cold case squad and back again) and turmoil in his personal life, including having his home destroyed in an earthquake. We saw him briefly married to Eleanor Wish, a former FBI agent who is now a professional poker player in Hong Kong; their daughter -- a daughter Harry never knew he had -- lives with her mother overseas. The story starts with a shooting in a liquor store; not an uncommon occurrence in LA. The victim is an elderly Chinese man, someone Bosch met many years ago, and he feels a strong connection to the case. He's a little out of his element -- he doesn't speak the language or understand the family's customs. Consulting with the Asian Gang Unit leads to suspicions that a Triad may be involved -- the victim appears to be paying off a customer with a suspicious tattoo on a surveillance tape.  Because Chu is unable to get a quick translation of the Chinese tattoos on the victim (which makes Bosch suspiscious), Bosch sends pictures of them to his daughter in Hong Kong. Maddie is able to make the translation and although Bosch cautions her to keep quiet about it, well, she's a teenaged girl with pictures of a real-life murder victim on her cell phone! She is bound to tell somebody. A few hours later, Bosch has a video message showing his daughter, tied to a chair, the victim of a kidnapping.  Hong Kong is a very different world from Los Angeles, but Bosch is determined to protect his daughter. His ex-wife, Eleanor, and her colleague, Sun Yee, are able to provide some help, but Harry is running on instinct. He needs to find his little girl before she disappears into an Asian underworld of triads and human traffickers.  The story moves at a whirlwind pace and sweeps you right along with it. The characters are real and honest -- there are no saints in this story and they will get a chance to try and atone for their sins. There are mistakes and mis-steps along with flashes of brilliant investigating. It's a terrific addition to a terrific series.",no

I didn't like the previous book, Lord of Sin, at all and finally ended up skimming through the last half of it just to get it over with. The plot was boring and convoluted, something to do with forged engravings. The hero, a wealthy earl with a special interest in collecting rare works by master engravers, travels to the Scottish highlands to help out a family he has never met in order to honor the final wish of his dying uncle. Way the heck up in the back hills of Scotland, he meets the heroine (the head of an impoverished family), who just HAPPENS to have learned the complex art of engraving from her father. Yuh-huh. Because EVERYBODY was into engraving back in the 1830's. I mean, who doesn't love a good engraving?  I really like this author. Most of the books in this series have been pretty good and the medieval romances I've read so far by this author have been fantastic. This book was just awful to me.

They are sturdy, well-made paperbacks, whose covers have been lengthened an inch or so and then turned in, like a book jacket. The paper is good and the print excellent. I have a set of their Dickens Christmas anthologies, which include the contributions by other people, and they are excellent. I have to say I didn't enjoy this one as much as those. If you've read Orwell - Road to Wigan Pier and Down and Out in Paris and London - or Henry Meyhew - London labour and the London Poor, you'll have found the same information better presented. Jack London was a poverty tourist, he dipped his toe into the tide of human misery but made sure he could scuttle back to better living pretty sharpish.  That's not to say there aren't some good things, the stories of the individuals he met, his compassion for the underworld (by which he meant the underclass rather than criminals) and his perception that, once a person began the fall from even relative prosperity, it was next to impossible to get out of the Abyss.

Mr. Farrow had previously commissioned sculptor Gideon Waring to create sculptures of each of the four winds to decorate the exterior of his home, Fourwinds; however, this sculptor was dismissed from the premises before the fourth sculpture was installed. Upon his arrival at Fourwinds, Samuel not only becomes entangled in the mysterious lives of his two students, Juliana and Marianne, and their governess, Charlotte Agnew, but he also develops a fascination with the sculptures left behind by Waring and decides to investigate the mystery of his dismissal and the missing fourth sculpture. Aided by Charlotte, Samuel makes discoveries that have life-changing consequences for all. I enjoyed this book so much that I charged through it in one day.

If oil were like salt The title refers to the development of technology that enabled food preservation without salt, so that salt producing nation lost their strategic hold. Can that happen with oil? For oil to become a non strategic commodity such that OPEC nations lose their strategic hold on world affairs. Some good points in the interview to start a discussion here. One of the insights that was significant to me - cannot believe I had not put the question in this frame. There are two distinct energy systems with different impact on oil: electric grid and transportation. In today's economy, the electric grid improvements will not impact energy independence to a great degree because we already have alternative sources in place. Primarily nuclear power and for some water. Developments in areas such as wind and ocean currents or solar may prove to be additional energy sources distinct from oil Transportation is the other system, much more dependence on oil. Improvements in this require focused efforts - battery, hybrid, effeciency, mass transit. This system is the more impacting with regard to energy independence. Another significant point made is that dependence on Middle Eastern oil cannot be overcome with more US drilling. The plain fact is that most of the known oil reserves are in OPEC states. Should we, non OPEC states, have a coordinated strategy to achieve energy independence? Could we have such a strategy - would developing nations, even China, join in as their nations are building an economic infrastructure? What should that strategy be? and what priority should it have?",no

The Adventurous Reader Challenge Imagine you are a literary Marco Polo, out exploring, bent on discovery. Chose a book from the library or bookstore shelves that you have heard nothing about. No one has recommended to you; you have not read about it in a blog or news source. You are UNfamiliar with the author. You have only the synopsis on the book and perhaps a few blurbs on the back of it to help you make your decision.  Essentially, the idea is that you come to the book cold, not having heard yea or nay about it. Yes, it's risky perhaps, but ah! the adventure. You are venturing into unknown territory. -- No prize winners or classics (they come with implied recommendations). -- Again, no authors you are familiar with  -- No checking recommendations on the book anywhere until AFTER you've read it and written comments on this thread. -- This, of course, will probably eliminate nearly all the books in your TBR pile, especially if you've been hanging out here on LT very long:-)  --new or older books okay, of course, as long as you've just discovered it.

9511,"I read this book in the late '70s or early '80s, though it may have been published a decade or two earlier. The book is set in England. It's about a girl who's sent from her home to stay with a family friend who lives somewhere on the coast. The girl has been silent and depressed (can't remember why), and her family hopes the trip will help her recover. The friend the girl is staying with is a well-off woman who employs an older woman as a servant. The girl sometimes thinks that the servant is a (benign) witch. After the girl arrives at the house, which is very old, she starts having very vivid dreams about a previous owner, a young man who is a ship's captain and is rarely home. One day the captain returns from a trip with a young woman he's rescued. She's foreign (Spanish, I think). Eventually she and captain marry, but the townspeople never really accept her. I don't remember what happens next. The modern-day girl is somehow helped by her dreams of the past and is able to go home well again at the end of the book. I don't remember the title or author. The cover of the book was very colorful. It showed drawings of some the characters and scenes in different colors. There was white in the background. If anyone has any ideas about the title or author of the book, I'd be very grateful. Thanks.",yes

In a six-part series, Clare follows the wheeltracks of compulsive cyclist and author Harold Briercliffe whose evocative guide books of the late 1940s lovingly describe by-passed Britain - a world of unspoiled villages, cycle touring clubs and sunny B roads. Carrying a set of Harold's Cycling Touring Guides for company and riding his very own bicycle, Clare embarks on six iconic cycle rides to try and find the world he described - if it's still there.""

95324,"(continued from here) For those new to this challenge: More info and monthly index can be found in post #1 of this thread. Simple directions for posting to the wiki can be found at the bottom of each month's wiki page.   ...logo by cyderry Man, oh, man! Have I been making this TIOLI challenge too easy for you!! This will change. Your challenge for the July 2010 TIOLI is to Read a book with an ISBN ending with the digit 4. Why? I like that number. It was my dads lucky number. Now that Ive effectively eliminated about 90% of your TBR pile, I want to see what you come up with! This month, rather than you picking the book to be read, you might find that your book is going to choose itself! :) Youll notice that some books have two sets of ISBNs (a 10-digit number and a 13-digit number). Each might end in a different digit. If at least one of them ends in a 4, youre good to go. If you want to learn more about the ISBN numbering system, have a look here on wikipedia. Addendum (6/26/10): If you can pull up your book by putting the ISBN into the Search box on the Add Books page of LibraryThing, it counts for the challenge whether or not it is printed in the book. The reason for this is that some books do have both a 13-digit and a 10-digit ISBN, but the 10-digit ISBN may no longer be printed in newer copies of the book. To help you find digit 4 books, just keep an eye on the wiki as this challenge fills up. Those should be good suggestions for others. Just think of this as a scavenger hunt. I hope you enjoy the book you finally find!!

95405,"Title of book needed -- published 1990s  The book had a family of four -- father, mother, older boy, younger girl -- in the midwest -- current day. There might have been a drought, but in any event, the family was in need of money and went out on a picnic where the younger girl fell down through a hole in the ground (possibly a well). She was rescued, but was never the ""same"" since that point. Turns out the family had planned to have the boy fall down in the hole as he was the older and then, of course, for him to be rescued. Only she fell in first. The girl grows up a little warped -- dreams of tree roots (the hardcover I believe had tree roots on the cover) and comes back for some kind of revenge against the boy or the town. A little hint of the supernatural as well. Tree roots and evil are used as metaphors for unknown evil. I don't believe that this was from a well-known mainstream horror author -- might have been a first novel and, for some reason, I don't think the author published anything else -- though I might be wrong here.  Creeped me out in a psychological way -- no overt evil presence, I don't think, just psychological terror.",yes

9568,"GOETHE: The Sorrows of Young Werther and VALDIMIR NABOKOV: Laughter in the Dark Werther was published in 1774 when Goethe was twenty-five; Laughter was published in 1932 when Nabokov was thirty-two and living temporarily in Berlin. They are, on the surface, quite dissimilar books. Werther caused a sensation and produced, 	""...a veritable cult of misery among disaffected youth, giving rise to the word Werthersfieber (""Werther's fever"") to describe the lovesick sadness and forlorn disaffection that gripped so many who modeled themselves on the work's eponymous hero."" Darrin McMahon: Happiness, A History It became a fad to imitate Werther's blue frock coat and yellow waistcoat as the uniform of a man of feeling. The book reflected the Zeitgeist of the ""age of sentiment"", and as a fictional case history, 	""...of a highly endowed and appealing individual who allows himself to drift into disaster under the spell of a passion the danger of which he fails to sense until his will to live has been sapped and his sanity undermined, the story has a powerful appeal for the psychologically oriented reader who follows the stages of the hero's mental disintegration..."" Foreword from the Signet Classics Version And this, succinctly summarizes the trajectory of the life of Nabakov's protagonist, Albinus, who throws over his life, wife, child and reputation for what he thinks is the love of a mistress who is only 16-17 years old. (Yes, shades of Lolita here.) Laughter opens with this arresting paragraph: 	""Once upon a time there lived in Berlin, Germany, a man called Albinus. He was rich, respected, happy; one day he abandoned his wife for the sake of a youthful mistress; he loved, was not loved; and his life ended in disaster"". Again, except for the part about abandoning a wife for a mistress, this could be a description of the lifeline of Werther himself. Both men die at the end of the novels, Werther willingly as suicide is the only way to relieve the intolerable angst of his unrequited love for Lotte; Albinus less willinglyhe is shot by his mistress, Margot, after a he fails to kill her for her faithlessnessbut even for Albinus it is a release. This is Albinus just after he has been shot: 	""So that's all. I must keep quiet for a little space than walk very slowly along that bright sand of pain, toward that blue, blue wave. What bliss there is in blueness. I never knew how blue blueness could be. What a mess life has been. Now I know everything. Coming, coming, coming to drown me. There it is. How it hurts. I can't breathe...."" What connects these two novels, so different in tone and time and structure, is a search for happiness that focuses on the ultimately unattainable; in Werther's case the passionate love of a woman who loves and respects him as a friend but who is happily married to another man, and for Albinus, a future with a much younger woman whom he does not see, until the very end, for the scheming, manipulating, unfaithful person that she is. Both protagonists are so blinded by their passions that they lose touch with the real world and their ultimate destructions come as no surprise. Neither can really see the folly of his ways, and although opportunities present themselves, neither can find the fortitude to build on inner strengths they do possess to overcome their fates.  Lotte summarizes it well when she tries to dissuade Wherther from the dark course that she sees his passion leading him: 	""Wherther...you mayyou must come to see us again, only be more moderate. Oh, why did you have to be born with so much vehemence, with this fixed, uncontrollable passion for everything you touch? I implore you, practice moderation! Your mindall your knowledge and talents...think of the happiness they can give you! Be more manly! Divert this tragic devotion from a human creature who can only pity you. ... Think calmly, Werther for just one moment. Don't you see that you are deceiving and ruining yourself on purpose? Why me, Werther? Why me of all people, who belongs to another? Why? I fear...I feat that is just the impossibility of possessing me that makes your desire for me so fascinating."" For Albinus, the crisis arrives after his young daughter has died of pneumonia: ""He remembered how, in the mirror, he had had a fleeting glimpse of his wife's eyes, in which there had been a heart-rendering expressionpitifulhuntedbut still akin to a smile. He pondered over all this with deep emotion. Yesif he were to go to his little girl's funeral, he would stay with his wife forever."" But Albinus does not go to the funeral because, again, he is seduced by the moment and by his own delusions: ""...as he stood by the bed and feasted his eyes on that childish face, with the soft pink lips and flushed cheeks, Albinus remembered their first night together and thought with horror of his future by the side of his pale, faded wife. This future seemed to him like one of those long, dim, dusty passages where one finds a nailed-up boxor an empty perambulator."" (What a very nice touch by Nabokov that the glimpse was ""in the mirror"", i.e. real but not direct, only seen as a reflection, not unlike the way Albinus approaches his whole life.) Neither Whether, nor Albinus, can get beyond themselves or the moment to see in what future their true happiness lies, just as neither can see, until the end, the destructive path that each has embarked upon. Both think that happiness can be found in the senses, in the here and now, and both give in to their passions without considering what they really mean. Werther's love is formally unrequited (try though he does to convince himself otherwise at certain points), as is the ""love"" that Albinus feels for Margot (though he would be hard pressed to define the word in that context), even though he fools himself, and is fooled, for a period of time. There is another, common feature in the appeal of both books: the universality of the stories they tell. As Alain de Botton The Consolations of Philosophy describes it: 	""Goethe's readers not only recognized themselves in The Sorrows of Young Werther, they also understood themselves better as a result, for Goether had clarified a range of the awkward, evanescent moments of love, moments that his readers would previously have lived through, though would not necessarily have fathomed. He laid bare certain laws of love...He had, for example, perfectly captured the apparently kindyet infinitely cruelmanner with which the person who does not love deals with someone who does."" Schopenhauer said that, ""The essence of art is that its one case applies to thousands."" They are very different stories, but this is as true for Werther as it is for Laughter.",no

97388," Hi! Welcome to my 2011 11 in 11 category challenge! All lurkers and posters welcome, as long as you're not spamming. This year, I have decided to simply give my categories names and NOT define them, and be free to use any books that can in any way fit the category name. I did a pretty good job of staying with my categories in 2010, but I was constantly tweaking the ""definition"" of what was included in several of them. I'm also going to allow more space for reading mysteries this year, and especially series -- trying new ones that have been recommended, and catching up with the next installment of old favorites. (That's the point of the ""leadoff"" and ""on-deck"" categories.)  In fact, in general, I'm just trying to allow more space for reading what I want to read. These are the category names I've chosen, as of now. I reserve the right to change my mind! (I also reserve the right to move books around from one category to another later in the year to balance things out if books can fit in more than one category.  1. Pregame 2. Play Ball! 3. Leadoff 4. On-deck 5. Phantom players 6. All-Stars, MVP's, & Other Awards 7. Foul Play Territory 8. Fireballers, Rainouts, Steals, & Errors! 9. Away Game Travel Day (Cars, trains, boats & planes, etc.) 10. Team Physician & Front Office (Doctor, Lawyer, Indian chief) 11. Team Chaplain extra category: Utility Players I know these are odd categories, and a lot of them are baseball-related terms, but I'm putting my own ""spin"" on them so I can put many different types of books into them! I already have books in mind that fit, one way or another, as I view the categories. And the ""utility players"" category is for the books that don't fit into the regular lineup! My plan is to do 7 books in each of these 11 categories -- a 7-11 challenge -- for a total of 77 books. Thus I'll need just 2 more books than the goal for my 75 challenge, if I manage to fit all the books here that I read. As a later development, I decided to have a main theme (or pair of themes) for each month: January: ""Cold white snow & ice of January"" February: ""Black History Month"" March: ""Spring Training / Mystery March"" April: ""Autism Awareness Month --and Support Your Library"" (for Natl. Library Week) May: ""May Murder & Mayhem -- & Motorsports"" June: ""Justice, Journeys, and Jazz"" July: ""Big League Cities"" August: ""Anything Goes"" September: ""Series & Sequels"" October: ""Halloween"" November: ""Fill in the Blanks"" December: ""Holidays and (other) December Disasters"" These themes are evolving over the course of the year, and subject to editing at any time. Not all of my reading will fit the monthly theme -- Early Reviewer books are totally exempt -- but I will try to include some aspect of the theme in at least half the books I read each month. Note that, like the categories, the book can fit the theme in any imaginable way. I'm going to try to provide most of the following as a heading for each book, as applicable: Challenge Book # Title: Author: Copyright/Year of original publication: Genre: Subject: Setting: Main Characters: Series: Dates Read: Number of pages: Off the Shelf? (pre-2011): Category for 11 in 11 challenge: How does it fit the category? Alternate category Does it fit the Theme of the Month How does it fit the theme? My Rating: Notes:",no

You can't really understand someone until you know the events from their past that they feel responsible for. The Robber Bride - Margaret Atwood I read this book when I was 18, and it was the first work of fiction I'd ever read in which I could recognize women from my own life. It had a profound impact on how I viewed my personal potential and my place in the world. Soul Mountain - Gao Xingjian Every person must find their own way in life. No matter how many people we have in our lives, we are always alone in our psychological and spiritual journey. An Adoration - Nancy Huston We can never fully know another person because our perception of them will always be influenced by our previous experiences with other people and with life. One Good Story, That One - Thomas King Whether we choose to see something as tragic or humourous depends entirely on how easy we find it to laugh at our own failings. Don Juan - Lord Byron  The book that taught me how to appreciate poetry. I read my copy until it fell apart during my senior year of high school.

It was a travel book, written by a woman traveling to Cuba and Mexico approximately during the Victorian era. I believe she was an American. It was a fairly thick book...maybe 600 pages or more. She may have been the wife of an ambassador or attach, but I'm not positive. I'm almost positive that the word ""Mexico"" was part of the title, and it may have been written in diary form. Thanks, in advance!!!",yes
98557,"Hey guys,  I read this series around 10 years ago, and would like to reread the series, but I can't remember or find the name of it. It was the story of men living in medieval-like times. I remember that it included Knights, Thieves, and women warriors. It was all about attempting to get into valhalla, and fights among the gods.  I remember that in one of the books there was a story about a man who lost both of his legs, but managed to learn how to fight on his horse, and still managed to get into valhalla. Any help would be appreciated!",yes

It would be nice if the same would happen to German titles starting with articles like ""ein"", ""eine"", ""eines"", ""der"", ""die"", ""das"" etc. This applies probably also to other languages and their respective indefinite and definite articles.",no

98974,"As some of you saw, we thought we were going down for an hour last night, and we were down for nearly eightYuck.  Basically, the process that went so smoothly and under-time on Sunday night went horrid last night, through a mix of user error (mine) and random weirdness. We ended up having to perform some rather taxing operations on large database tables, and that took time. Until about 4am, the problems were hardly noticed, leading us to underestimate how long it would take to finish. We're now up, although one of our main databases is still recovering, so we're in ""throttled"" mode, which turns off non-member access to some pages. We will be fully up soon. Anyway, apologies and thanks. Tim",no

99936,I think this is a relatively recent book. I read less than five years ago but I can't recall the title of the book. It's about a boy around the time of the Civil War in the U.S. and I'm not sure but I think he's white and he works on farm with his dad or a relative. And all this dramatic stuff happens to him. It was a rather long novel compared to those in the juvenile section but I believe it would be categorize there. Possibly young adult. I don't know who the author is but I do remember the cover page was green and there was a boy on it. The title might've had the word 'moonshine' or 'kerosene' but I'm sure the story had something to do with moonshine (perhaps the farm produced moonshine). I'm sorry if this is a little vague but I can't remember anything else except that I really enjoyed it.,yes
