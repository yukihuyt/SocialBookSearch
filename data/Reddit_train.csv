Over the last couple years, Robert Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga put out a 3-part series of novels (the last book was split in 2, so there are actually 4 books) that fans of the show are pretty split on -- they either seem to love it or hate it. I myself have not read the series, but I recently bought the first book and I was wondering what others thought of The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor and the series as a whole. [Btw, here's some info on book 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead:_Rise_of_the_Governor)

I didnt expect what happened next.: So like the title says I read two of Camus' books and decided to take a break for a bit and read something light hearted and carefree. I didn't anticipate how I would end up feeling. I picked up a worn copy ofPercy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief from my bookshelf. I should clarify, I have two bookshelves. One is on display in my room. It has all of my ""real"" literature. Intellectually stimulating books, mostly philosophical, and adult fantasy (LOTR and ASOIAF). Its also got Harry Potter, because that was my first series. My second bookshelf, in my closet, is filled with REALLY old books, mostly from middle school. Eragon and its sequels, The Thief Lord, Artemis Fowl, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Now, I sort've had forgotten about this bookshelf, as I outgrew all the books there. Anyway, I picked up The Lightning Thief and finished it in one day. Over the next 3 days I read the next 3 books, each in one day. Now I'm on the 5th and final book in the series (Apparently Riordan, the author, has written a sequel series but I have no interest in pursuing it). For whatever reason, rereading these books is painfully melancholic for me. I don't know why. Percy Jackson series is by no means impressive writing, and at the time of me reading it as a kid I don't remember being all too blown away by it. Rereading it now however is affecting me in a big way and I dont understand why. Has anyone ever experienced something similar? ",0

2f5l7y,"Theory about link between The Shining & The Hobbit: 
Ok, so this is just a theory and I welcome your thoughts...  (sorry it's long!!  Also I already know that I’m not an expert on literature, or on either book, or on anything.)

So I was watching The Desolation of Smaug on HBO earlier and when Bilbo & the dwarves reach the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo says something about Gandalf should be waiting for us at ""the overlook.""  Somehow, that sent a flag up in my mind, so I did some research online.  To summarize, I think that Stephen King's book ""The Shining"" is somewhat based on this section of The Hobbit.

The Overlook/Lonely Mountain =  The Overlook Hotel in the Rocky Mountains

Thror = Delbert Grady (previous hotel caretaker)

Thorin = Jack Torrence

Bilbo =  Danny Torrence

Gandalf =  Dick Hallorann

Smaug = Hotel Boiler
 
Arkenstone = Psychic Powers

Sauron (?) = Horace Derwent (?) <evil in the hotel>


1.  Stephen King is a big Tolkien fan who has a history of setting LOTR
stuff into the United States (he admitted it about “The Stand” in Stephen King from A to Z: An Encyclopedia of His Life and Work)


2.  The Lonely Mountain is the source of the Celduin River and it’s the location of the Kingdom Under the Mountain.  The town of Dale lies in a vale on its Southern slopes.  Correspondingly (maybe) the Overlook Hotel is set in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and has the town of Vail to the South.  The Colorado River’s source is here.


3.  Dale and the surrounding areas, which were burnt by Smaug, are called “The desolation of Smaug.”  There is a place called East Desolation Peak near the real Overlook hotel—the Stanley hotel—which Stephen King said was where he stayed and that inspired the fictional Overlook hotel.


4.  In The Hobbit, the Overlook area has a tragic history due to all the deaths & destruction from the dragon.  In The Shining, the Overlook hotel has a violent past including the deaths of guests and more recently, the deaths of the last caretaker and his family—he “got cabin fever” and killed them.


5.  In the Peter Jackson movie, Thror (Thorin Oakenshield’s predecessor as King Under the Mountain) went mad with greed.  However, Smaug the dragon implies that it was the Arkenstone that corrupted him when he says to Bilbo, “I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer, watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad…”   I don’t know much about Thror, but the Arkenstone gave it’s owner the authority/power to rule the dwarves.  So maybe he was power & money hungry?  Anyway, in The Shining, I assume that the previous caretaker, Delbert Grady, actually went crazy from the same evil spirits who influence Jack Torrence.  One of these “spirits” is a past owner(?) of the Overlook named Horace Derwent.  Derwent is described as being an “evil genius” who was extremely corrupt and got rich from his involvement in organized crime, high level politics, gambling, etc.  It is said that his spirit inhabits the Overlook Hotel, but his death was never confirmed. (WTF?)   The evil spirits of the Overlook (especially Derwent) desperately want Jack to kill Danny in order to obtain his shining/psychic powers.  Jack gradually loses himself because of he is influenced or possessed to kill Danny.  In the same way, Thorin Oakenshield begins to lose himself and change because he becomes obsessed with getting the Arkenstone.


6.  Therefore, I think that the Arkenstone = The Shining/Psychic powers.  The Hobbit book says that the Arkenstone has it’s own pale light, but when exposed to outside light, it shone brilliantly.  When Danny first arrives at the Overlook hotel and meets the cook, Dick Hallorunn (who also has the shining ability), he warns Danny that the hotel is dangerous for people with the gift and can intensify it.
Now, I am not an evil spirit, so I don’t know why the hotel’s evil spirits want psychic abilities, but maybe it has something to do with the power to rule over others, like the Arkenstone’s significance to the dwarves.


7.  The previously mentioned Dick Hallorunn has a special connection/friendship with Danny because he can see that Danny has the shining power like he does, and also likely because Danny is a nice kid and Dick is a nice person.   Maybe it’s because he knows that Danny is in for a dangerous time and he can relate because he has worked in the hotel and knows its evil.  But, for whatever reason, they have a bond and a connection.  Similarly, Gandalf has a special place in his heart for Bilbo saying (in the movie) “Why Bilbo Baggins?  Perhaps it is because I am afraid and he gives me courage.’  Now, in The Shining, Hallorunn leaves the Overlook hotel for the winter and has to come back to help save Danny from Jack.  In the same way, Gandalf is not at the Overlook /Lonely Mountain while Bilbo is dealing with Thorin and the dragon.  But, Gandalf comes to help the situation at the end.


8.  Sort of covered before---  Bilbo is brave and selfless.  He is willing to risk facing a dragon to look for the Arkenstone.  Spoiler:  He is willing to give up the Arkenstone to avoid a war.  Danny is also very brave and selfless.  In The Shining (book), Danny’s mom, Wendy, wants to leave Jack behind early on an take Danny away from there, but Danny resists because he thinks the hotel is making Jack happy.  Danny is also able to face all the creepy stuff that happens in the hotel.  


9.  Smaug the dragon has been sleeping deep in the mountain, but awakens due to Bilbo’s presence.  He starts getting really mad, breathes lots of fire, and then destroys part of the Lonely Mountain getting out of it.  At the end of the book The Shining, the boiler in the basement of the hotel (which had ostensibly not been used until the winter) is turned on and gets hotter and hotter until it explodes and destroys the hotel.


10.  Ok, finally, I know it’s a stretch but  Torrence sounds like Thorin (kinda)

*Weird fact, the book The Shining was nominated for a Gandalf award in 1978

Oh---I didn't include references, but it's because I didn't keep track of all the websites I visited.  So, my source is: internet

2kyncs,"[Recommendation] How to Read Literature Like a Professor: A Lively and Entertaining Guide to Reading Between the Lines - Thomas C Foster: An extremely enjoyable &amp; easy to read text that gives a great introduction to exactly what it says on the label. It covers recognising patterns &amp; interpreting some common symbols in literature with great examples (water, meals, journeys, disability/illness, weather/seasons - among a host of others). I saw it recommended in /r/books very recently as a text for lit courses (thank you /r/books!) I've never done any study in that area &amp; am aware this means I miss a lot in my day to day reading. And I hate missing stuff. I want clued in on everything, always. 

It definitely doesn't pretend to cover all there is to know - it is a simple introduction. I have no illusions that this has made me an expert &amp; in the example the author gives at the end I failed miserably to interpret most of it. But at least I have made a start. Now I just need to go back &amp; reread every book I've ever read to figure out what I missed :)

The author clearly loves what he does. He writes in an enthusiastic, easy to follow &amp; understand, conversational tone. 

I read the audiobook, narrated by David de Vries. The narration is excellent - could not be better. de Vries reads like he wrote this stuff. He sounds as enthusiastic about it all as the author is.

This would be must read for people who love literature but have never taken a lit course. Also excellent for high school students studying English.

I wish there was a ""part two."" I would be all over it!
