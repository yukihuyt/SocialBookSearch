101078,"As long as we're on the subject of what direction should the FS take... what do you think about limited editions? Personally, I love them! They tend to be of higher quality than ""normal"" FS books (not that normal books are not of high quality of course), and are far more expensive. I would love to see  1)More Limited Editions in the vein of Rubiyt and Wind in the Willows, although at lower prices ($1100 for Wind the Willows makes it a no-purchase for me, especially when I can purchase the Rackham-illustrated version by Easton Press for $75)! Of course I realize that to lower prices some sacrifices may have to be made (smaller book size, perhaps fewer illustrations, etc)... but I'm OK with that as long as we still get a beautiful limited edition with a signature by the artist (and author if he/she is still alive :) 2)More rare facsimiles! Perferably something that has not been done before -such as Night Thoughts in color, and the Surinam album.  3)Along the lines of my first point, perhaps the FS can continue with their ultra-expensive signed LEs such as Rubiyt if they so wish (they seem to sell-out, so I'm sure the FS plans on producing more), but then release smaller-sized and more affordable LEs. For example, produce LE Fairy Books that are exactly the same as the normal Fairy Books, except they include the artist's signature on a limiations page, and produce a few thousand of these. Charge $300 per book, and I'm sure the FS would quickly sell out of them, and we would have a nice LE at an affordable price. ",no
101121,"Having now finished three batches of 75 books, and read about 400 plus books so far this year in total, I'm starting what will probably be my final 75-book challenge.

As before, I'll list the latter books here along with the ""75"" reads, but there's no overlap on my lists.

10113,"I was delighted to discover today that God is an author on LT. Let no one say that religion is in decline or under threat from the corrupt, decadent (and clearly Liberal, if not Leftist) forces of Science, Philosophy and Reality which not only undermine our basic human decency but also the very fabric of civilization. Let no one say that G_d/God/Jesus Christ, Nazareth, zip code 1- is not in the true hearts of His followers in this time of crisis, only a few years after the End passed us by (but is yet to come - again.) My heart swells to see this sign of faith, this genuine congregation, amidst all the sins of the Int_rn_t. I was so touched, in fact, that I decided to help my Brothers and Sisters in combining Authors, as part of my Work here on Earth. Some names bespoke real faith (such as G_d, The Living God, YHWH, Lord God Almighty, of course! God and duh God) while others appear to me to border on the sacrilegious (such as God the Holy Spirit and some dead guys and God Allegedly) - nevertheless, I let the latter be in case they see the Light and learn from their Errors. However, I have begun to experience Doubt, struggling with these troubling questions: 1) Is it acceptable to say that God has/had editors or publishers, if they all released the same works, titles and editions (please see, for example, God Almighty (K. Elliger & W. Rudolph eds.) or Lockman Foundation? Should we assume that the latter were ordained by God, as in the case of the current Pope, or should we write to them and to booksellers to stop such preposterousness and change the author names on all their MARC records and books immediately? A petition could be arranged, but I thought I'd seek advice first. 2) It seems logical that if Jesus Christ has an entry, so should Jesus H. Christ, but apparently the latter is the author of Whips and Furs Uk Only (Attack!). I'm not sure what to make of this. Could this be a reference to a whip allegedly used by Jesus on merchants in the Temple, or is there a Gospel I missed? Similarly, if there's a God, there should be a Goddess too, in these F_m_n_sm ravaged times, but I am confused again because the latter is the author of Safe Beginnings: An Exploration of BDSM Lifestyles. What is BDSM? Could it be Belief in the Divine Supremacy of the Messiah? Or Bringing forth the Deity through Sublime Means? I'm experiencing Anguish now because I feel I may have missed something during catechism, or one of those sermons that put me to sleep, some Holy Secret everyone else knows but doesn't talk about. Please, could some true Believers help me out? 3) Finally, I believe that all Gods are merely manifestations of the One. But when I tried to combine Allah with God, I got a message saying the two should never be combined! What's this - does someone on LT feel that only some believers are allowed into the Kingdom of Heaven, while others hang around at the Gates waiting for the next ballot, haggling with touts and scalpers and elbowing each other to get in? Not to mention that I see no entry for many other Gods. Jehovah was around, along with Horus and Krishna, but I couldn't find Zeus, for instance, or Vishnu. I pinned the whereabouts of Gilgamesh and the Buddha (technically he wasn't a God as he made no claims to divinity and expressed Agnosticism, but he is worshipped by many and considered a sort of Messiah), but I'm not sure I have the right Apollo or Athena. Re, Osiris, Jove and a bunch of other Romans and Egyptians are proving elusive, and Quetzalcoatl is nowhere to be found. I feel that unless we get more names, a profile of our Beloved author will be forever incomplete. So, a plea to some of you - could you please help me find God?",no

101345,"Regenesis it's a sequel, and I sometimes find these hard to review. Is it clear enough how much it differs or relies on the preceeding book? I did quite enjoy it, and I'm also not sure how well I've conveyed this - without the review becoming too long? Thoughts: Regenesis After a 20 year wait we finally have the worthy successor to Cyteen, not quite there in terms of absolute intensity, but still a very fine novel with CJC at the top of her game. It picks up almost immediately from the end of Cyteen which should definitely be read beforehand. Cyteen covered over 30 years of elapsed time, but Regenesis is compressed into 9 short months. The plot - as expected in a CJC novel - is complex with many twists and turns in the 700 pages. Young Ari at 18 is just coming into her powers, and beginning to investigate the actions of her guardians around her - aware that her predecessor's reputation has created personal feuds and policy based dissent. But this Ari isn't like her predecessor in many important ways - despite all of the programs efforts to ensure identity. Young Ari cares for the people around her, and is prepared to go to some efforts to ensure they are as safe and happy as can be arranged - providing they don't run counter to her own interests. Soon her tendrils of investigation run to the department head and Councillor for Science in the Union government. (A position she's likely to hold in the future). His actions aren't those that she would have taken, but in the interest of harmony she doesn't intervene, until she realises that Defence is interweaved with this arrangement, and several key seats are soon due for re-election determining the fate of the entire Union. Meanwhile her nearest equivalent the Parental Replicate Justin and his companion Grant appreciate their being on the right side of the new Ari, and are determined that Justin's father Jorden won't mess up their new situation for them. Even though they do sympathise with his position. Unusually for CJC there is even a definitive and happy ending! It's very long, and as always with a CJC book the start is quite slow - at least the first half of the book is little more than laying out how much (or little) has changed since the end of Cyteen. This also allows a careful reader to understand the politics of Cyteen and how their government works. It is perhaps less illuminating on the matter of the Azi, though this was fundamentally covered in Cyteen. Given that was over 20 years between the two books and CJC has written many others in-between she has done a remarkable job in keeping the atmosphere and style in Regenesis very similar to the original. Not just the characters and setting but the very tone of the writing still captures the original dynamic of Cyteen and the Union which is very unlike any of her other work. It isn't however perfect. Some of the young Ari's key companions Horse for example barely get a mention, and many of her friends a little more than named bit parts. Which is unfortunate when they've been granted significant roles in the plot. Given the very prolonged build up the ending does come very suddenly, but this is true of many of CJCs books. I'm sure many people would prefer more action and less thinking - but the whole point of Ari is that she is a social scientist. Thinking is what she does. Overall I greatly enjoyed this, I was fully immersed in the details of the world, and didn't want to surface to deal with Real Life. It needs several distraction free hours to properly keep all the details in perspective. But very worthwhile reading. ",no

Simple directions for posting to the wiki can be found at the bottom of each month's wiki page.   ...logo by cyderry ------------------ Hi Challengers!  Welcome to Novembers TIOLI challenge which is to Read a Book in Alphabetical Order.  READ THESE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY as this challenge will work a bit differently than previous challenges!  I picked the first book which has a title starting with letter A. The next person to sign up for this challenge may either match an existing book (in this case, the one Ive already picked whose title starts with letter A) or add a book with a title starting with letter B (the next letter in the alphabet). The third challenger may match any existing book (A or B) or add a book starting with the next letter of the alphabet (C).  No letters may be skipped. Not even Q, ""X"" or Z. After Z, begin again with an A title, but add it after the Z title for this challenge only, please. You may list more than one book for this challenge, but not sequentially. In other words, one person may *not* list two books back to back at the same time (in case of a shared book, this might happen, but then it would be okay).  To be consistent with alphabetization elsewhere within the TIOLI challenges, the words a, an, and the will *not* count as the beginning word of any title for this challenge. Sorry!  In summary, either match an existing book title (anywhere within this challenge) or add another book in alphabetical order only.  Addendum #1: No two books beginning with the same letter of the alphabet may be listed unless they are shared books or unless we being a second (or third) A to Z cycle. Addendum #2: A shared read may be added at any time and may be slipped in anywhere to the main challenge.  In case you decide not to read a book you listed for this challenge, please do NOT remove it from the wiki until after November 30 (or youll mess up the alphabetical order).

I've gotten a little bit of a jump start on her suggested November start date, because I have some time over the weekend. You'll recall that we decided to have quarterly theme reads for 2011, instead of monthly ones, to allow more people to participate over the course of three months and to allow those who are interested to read several books that fit a theme. At the same time, Lois will establish threads for country groupings to give people a place to go to talk about books from a country or region and to get ideas for books to read. This thread is designed to get your ideas for the four theme reads for 2011. All ideas are welcome! Let's discuss this during November and come up with a list of ideas. Then I'll figure out some way we can vote for the ones we want while maintaining an interesting mix and in December we can determine what the theme reads will be and who will coordinate each one. For reference, our past theme reads have included such diverse topics as Dictators/Dictatorships, Nature/Living Close to the Land, Aboriginal/First People's Literature, Ocean Adventures, and Voluntary Immigration. The complete list of both theme reads and geographic reads is on the Reading Globally group page. So, what are your ideas? Edited to fix link.",no

101810,"So I've been thinking lately is a Bible a myth. And the two difinitions I'm using in the term myths are  1.a set of stories, traditions, or beliefs associated with a particular group or the history of an event, arising naturally or deliberately fostered 2. The body of myths belonging to a culture. Myths are traditional stories about gods and heroes. They often account for the basic aspects of existence  explaining, for instance, how the Earth was created, why people have to die, or why the year is divided into seasons. Copied those straight from Dictionary.com. I say it is, especially from someone who doesn't believe in God, but I'm not nessisarily saying it's false. I'm just saying that it is a collection of stories that may or may not be true. So what do you think? Is the Bible a myth?",no

102352,"This thread has one main purpose: To help newbies to BookMooch! Everyone in this thread has been a newbie on BookMooch & we've learned a lot about things that can help you to have a fantastic BookMooch experience... And if you introduce yourself, then we can mooch from you!!! There's a Wiki page for BookMooching ( http://wiki.bookmooch.com/ )... lots of great info there!! Some good threads to check out are the ""General BookMooch Questions"", the ""Angels Needed/Offered"", ""Pimp Your Inventory"" and the notorious ""Rant/Complaining"" thread... and to counter that: ""I Just Had A Great Experience on Bookmooch"" thread!! (no links because some of these change on a regular basis) Generally good suggestions to start BookMooching: **Don't list any more books than you could mail out to start. seriously. Some BMers have listed their books & had almost all books mooched immediately... think $$. Don't get overwhelmed with too many mooches to start. **Condition notes are very nice. Even if you only put good, very good, or 'the dog nibbled a corner'. Most will choose a book with a condition over one without. You can even offer books that are awful, just put it in the condition notes.. someone may want a book to take to the beach or vacation & not worry about having to bring it back or keep it looking nice!! **Status Notes: On your profile page is a section called Status. This message is posted with your book every time someone mooches. Let others know if your house has pets or smokers... if you send books immediately or every two weeks or you will be out-of-town for the next five years... anything that you would like to know from others, they want to know from you. **Wrap your books for rough mailing!! Try to put some type of waterproof & tear-resistant packaging around your books. Tape is good... (don't use scotch, magic or 'office desk' tape) Padding really helps!! recycle your padded envelopes. Pretend that the post office is staffed by elephants & gorillas. (but they're not... really) TAPE IS GOOD!! **Multiple Mooches If someone mooches two or more books from you, send them in one package!! Yes, it is OK!! They are trying to help you keep your postage costs down per mooch-point!! Plus, they are telling you that you are listing some really great books!! **If there are other books the (current) owner has, but you are out of points, ask them to reserve the book for you & wait on mailing the other books!! That way all the books can be mailed together, making it a very happy day when they arrive!! **Communicate!!! Keep your moochers informed!! If your books are going to be delayed, let them know... Stuff happens. Thank people!! Smooch if you can, smile when you can't. **Ask questions. If someone does something that you don't understand or gives you feedback you don't like, ask about it. Knowing that you care enough to ask about a situation will often smooth any ruffled feathers. **Consider shipping internationally. It is often less expensive per point than mooching within your country... sometimes even cheaper than shipping within your country. **EMAILS: Some BM emails are caught by Spam filters... Check your Spam Folder & add BookMooch.com as an approved domain. The problem is that the mail comes from the BM servers, but has the BMer as the reply address. Many spam filters don't approve of that. **The ""Abuse"" button. This is actually a notification button. If you are having problems with another BMer, you can click this button & explain the problem. There are some volunteers that mediate &/or solve problems that sometimes occur. And if one of those volunteers should contact you, its ok.. they are really here to help you.... and help BookMooch. They don't want you to get into deep problems... they are like lifeguards to help prevent you getting in too deep & drowning in the deep pile of books you might have to send or receive!! . . . Enjoy!! Getting a book in the mail is a little spontaneous birthday party. Revel in it. . (to experienced BMers, PM me with more ideas or post below this. Then we can copy this thread starter onto subsequent incarnations.. and improve BM for everyone... more BMers means more books to mooch!! & more BM friends!!) **This thread starter will be edited as suggestions are received... ... please remind me if you want any changes to this starter thread... Here are the two previous Newbie threads because there is so much good information!!! Newbie BookMooch Thread #1 Newbie BookMooch Thread #2 and the Newbie Thread/forums on the Bookmooch site Newbie BookMooch Thread AT BookMooch.com They do have some good ideas over there!! ;) and feel free to add ideas to the thread.

102807,"So right now I'm listening to music while reading a book and typing this message at the same time and I got this very wierd concept for a writing style for a book. What if the book was a musical. No that's not right, it's not a true musical, the book just has songs in it. Ok, let me clearify it better and start over. In a book there is real songs, the characters don't interact with the songs so you can't say it's a musical, but the book is more like a bunch of written musical videos put together that fits into one book that makes sense. Do I make sense? I think that idea would be terribly confusing. I mean, for one thing, you're reading the book, not listening to it, so you are just seeing the lyrics and also besides the song, there are the scenes that's actually happening besides the music, so how could you possibly seperate that, and also, you would have to really know what the meaning to the song is otherwise you'll be so confused.   Like right now I'm listening to Mockingbird by Rob Thomas. Let me try to write an example. Don't know how to do italics so the lyrics would be in bold. EVERYONE ELSE IS SMILING MAN THOSE SMILES DON'T FADE. I just doesn't feel the love or compasion anymore. YOU DON'T EVEN WONDER WHY YOU DON'T THINK THAT WAY.

We were perfect together? WELL MAYBE WE JUST HAD ENOUGH. WELL, MAYBE WE AIN'T MEANT FOR THIS LOVE. What's the point in living? ME AND YOU TRIED EVERYTHING. AND STILL THAT MOCKINGBIRD WON'T SING. I went over to my pistol and loaded it. WELL THIS LIFE SEEMS HARD ENOUGH. WELL MAYBE WE AIN'T  MEANT FOR THIS LOVE. I took it to my head and pulled the trigger.

Simple directions for posting to the wiki can be found at the bottom of each month's wiki page.   ...logo by cyderry ------------------ Hi Challengers!  Its getting tougher and tougher to come up with some new ideas about what books to challenge you to read. Heres one that should get you pulling some books off your bookshelf, though.  My challenge to you for December, 2010, is to Read a book with an Animal pictured on the Front Cover. The story inside the book may or may not have anything to do with animals. Your edition of the book *must* have a picture of an animal on its front cover even if youre only trying to match a book already posted. The kind of animal pictured on the cover of the same book title need not match a book already posted, but it must be noted. For example, if more than one animal is pictured on the book cover, you and another challenger might choose to mention a different animal for the same book. Ha! Some books only have half an animal on the front cover. Go figure! I'd say that would be okay for this challenge as long as you can pretty much identify what animal it is. The animal may also be miniscule. Let's say there's a bird flying in the distant sky at sunset. You can see those black wings. That's okay for this challenge.

Which of the narrators can you trust? What's really going on? I loved it, and even my husband (who doesn't normally read novels) opened it to while away a boring train journey and ended up hooked.",no

104652,"A recent offering from the NYT Stone column  is an intriguing angle on a plea for tolerance. Contrasting the nihilism of Nietzsche's ""God is Dead"" with the intolerance of the fanatics at the fringes of religion, Sean D. Kelly invokes Melville who  hoped for ... a life that steers happily between two dangers: the monotheistic aspiration to universal validity, which leads to a culture of fanaticism and self-deceit, and the atheistic descent into nihilism, which leads to a culture of purposelessness and angst. To give a name to Melvilles new possibility  a name with an appropriately rich range of historical resonances  we could call it polytheism.

104756,"I read this book in 1999 in 8th grade for a middle school academic decathlon. I can't remember title or author. All I know is that it was set around the time Jesus lived and was about to be crucified. The main character lived alone with his sister. I think both of their parents died already. If I remember correctly, his sister was disabled in some way... not sure. He was really protective of her. A roman soldier or something came by to see his sister a lot, which really pissed him off. I think later he joined some kind of cult or rebellion. I remember Jesus being a minor character in the book (not sure if he had lines), but still significant in some way to the group that the main character joined.  I can't remember if the book was religious or not. I do remember the main character being really cynical about everythign but eventually loosening up with regard to his sister and the roman soldier.  Does this sound familiar to anyone? if it helps, this book was required for the jr high school academic decathlon for anyone who did the literature section in 1999. I greatly enjoyed the book and would appreciate any help towards finding it. Thanks.",yes

104850," Blackdogbooks' rating scheme:  This book's writer is about to be banned from the doghouse (aka, the library); I may not have even finished it.  I probably finished the book, but only because I wanted to write a review; gonna trade it for something better at the used bookstore.    Not very good reading, but I finished it because I was curious about a character or the ending or sniffed something tasty.  Approaching readable material, but only approaching.  Average book; solid.  Slightly better than the pulp mills put out; I might read something else by this author.  Squarely above average; good writing and good story-telling.  Almost perfect reading experience; just one or two passages kept it from paw-lickin' good.  Superb reading experience; I forgot I was reading.

BOOKS IN PROGRESS, but NOT ACTIVELY READING Borrowing this idea from my daughter, who is a smart cookie, I'm going to keep a list here of books I've begun to read and then drifted away from, so I don't entirely forget that I might want to get back to them sometime. These are not books I've given up on...those I will note as I toss 'em aside. If I return to one of these and finish it, I'll strike through the title here and add it to my finished list where it belongs.  Satan's Circus by Mike Dash (116/354) Mike wasn't dashing to the central story quickly enough, and I got distracted. I will go back and finish this one. Travels With Myself and Another by Martha Gellhorn (62/294) Found it heavier going than I expected, and the time wasn't right. Love Gellhorn, though. Straight on Till Morning By Mary S. Lovell (55/347) Went straight on from Beryl Markham's memoir, West With the Night, to this biography of Markham, and found it was too much too soon. I also found Lovell too inclined to speculate about her subject's feelings. Will let it rest and try again one day. Werewolves in Their Youth by Michael Chabon (52/212) Short stories. I read two. It's by the bed, and I may stick another one in between books from time to time, although I don't think they were grabbing me very hard. The Knife Man by Wendy Moore This was fascinating stuff---history of surgery. Can't remember what lured me away from it.",no

104969,"I checked this hardcover fiction book out from the University of Illinois at Chicago library in 1988; it may have been a translation, red cover, not new even then. The first half of the book is written from the point of view of an unknown narrator who finds himself in a small riverfront town during a spectacular festival, and he recounts and marvels at the miraculous events unfolding around him. The second half of the book is an account of the same events from an insider's point of view, and we see that the miracles are really quite easily explained, and accomplished with ordinary means. I was captivated by this book and read it a few times, but I was in graduate school and my brain lost the title. Can anyone help me? I'd love to reread it. Thank you!",yes

105136," Ilya Glazunov: illustration for Netochka Nezvanovna by FMD 1970 It is terrible to watch a man who has the incomprehensible within his grasp, does not know what to do with it, and sits playing with a toy called God! Letter from Dostoevsky to his brother Mikhail Mikhailovich, about Hoffmanns tale The Magnetiseur. 1838. After The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor, its difficult to imagine anything more powerful, that Dostoevsky could pull off something like that again. But in this chapter he gives us an even more powerful picture: the devil visits Ivan. Or does he? This chapter is the epitome of Dostoevskys poetics regarding paradox and the techniques of ambiguation through laughter, irony, and Dostoevskys absolutely corrosive sarcasm. At the same time it brings together so many of the arguments pertaining to belief and atheism that run through the novel, and through Dostoevskys post-1862 career, that its worth looking at in more detail.  A possible key to understanding the chapter lies in Voltaires maxim, which has already appeared several times in the novel already: If God does not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. Here, of course, the maxim has been changed by implication to: If the Devil does not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. And so Dostoevsky does invent him to explore what possibilities this raises in illuminating the struggle between belief and atheism. The whole chapter plays with the idea: does the devil exist, or is he an emanation of Ivans mind? This is crucial, because its not only a literary question on the level of the novel, but its also a religious question, on the level of belief. The ambiguity of the status of the devils existence is very carefully maintained by the narrative, which goes to great pains to suggest that the devil is only an emanation, while at the same time endowing the devil with the greatest realism possible.  Im going to do a chronological close reading of the chapter, dwelling on anything which catches my attention. Please add-subtract-question- ignore - hector -etcetera at will. ",no

The average number of books I read a year is 100 so meeting this challenge shouldn't be that hard, but I read that the group is more about connecting with fellow readers. I also hope to receive some recommendations based off those books I read in 2011 to add to my growing 'list of books to read'. I read a lot of fantasy, but I have begun to broaden my horizons in the last year, so there will probably be a variety. I can list my favorite authors now so you can decide if following my thread will be interesting or not. :) I enjoying reading George R. R. Martin, Robin Hobb, Kate Elliott, , Terry Goodkind, Bart Yates, Elizabeth Chadwick, Melanie Rawn, Elizabeth Haydon and many many more.  Cant wait till 2011!

105403,"The recent discussion about Charles Fort on the ""Giving to LOA"" thread made me think about my reading habits. I had mentioned Charles Fort as someone who I would like included in LOA. For those that don't know, Fort wrote about unexplained phenomena. At this point, he is a cult figure for nerds who enjoy unexplained phenomena and what not; but hugely influential and has some interesting things to say. In this discussion, I mentioned that I have a ""tolerance for crap"". What I mean by that is that I am able to find enjoyment in things that others find low brow. This is similar to my taste in cinema. I worked at a movie theater in my younger days and was able to go to all the movies I wanted for free. As such, my now wife and I would see tons of things, both good and bad. I have always been able to go to a rather serious ""Film"" and enjoy it, and also go see a less serious ""Movie"" and enjoy it. In my opinion, why shut myself off to enjoying it all? This is echoed in my taste for books. In the LOA sphere, I am a big fan of the Hammett and Lovecraft volumes, though I am greatly enjoying my ""more serious"" selections as well. This I suppose is why I can want an authoritative volume on Fort: because its enjoyable and fun. So then, my question is whether this attitude is at odds with the spirit and goal of LOA? Even if it is, does that make me odd or do the rest of you explore out in the world less literary? ",no

The title of the book cited must have one word, at least, which is the same as a word in the previous title. 4. The repeated word in the new title must be other than an article (""a"", ""an"", or ""the""). 5. The repeated word must be spelled exactly as the word was spelled in the previous title. E.g., ""prune"" is not the same word as ""prunes"", and ""loyal"" is not the same word as ""loyalty."" 6. The repeated word must be in the title as shown in a LT library listing, or on the title page of the book. A sub-title or a series name can be included if the sub-title or series name is included in the title of a LT library listing, or is printed on the title page of the book. 7. A hyphenated word is one word, not two: e.g., ""thunder-clouds""; and if used must be repeated in full, not in part only. 8. If you have read the book it would be informative that you so indicate and tell when you read it, if you can. 9. Try to use Touchstones. Put brackets around the title and double brackets around the author. If Touchstones don't work, try using an HTML link. continued from here.  last post: Message 309: LynnB Maps for Lost Lovers by Nadeem Aslam ",no

10558,I just found librarything this week so I'm getting a bit of a late start. I'm curious to see how much I actually read by the end of the year. My list is starting with the book I finished this morning. 1. Heyday by Kurt Andersen 2. Yellow Eyes by John Ringo,no
105599,"Welcome to another year of fun, reading, and chit-chat about life in Maine. I'm not setting out any goals this year, except to become more acquainted with my Nook so I can take advantage of books that the library offers in Epub format. Last year I read 180+ books but there are several trips planned for 2011 so if I'm going to be able to read as much as a I like to, I'll have to be able to cart books with me electronically. I'm also going to experiment with a different reporting format by NOT posting the cover when I list a book I've finished. You can always click on the book and go to the page to see the cover. Keeping the graphics down should help my fellow readers who are on slower connections when they try to load a thread. If you've been around for awhile, you know that I am an audiobook fanatic--I listen to AT LEAST two audio books a week, since I have a 25 mile (1hour) RT drive to the YMCA where I do water aerobics for another 45 minutes 4 times a week. I have a waterproof MP3 player and listen to books while I drive and swim. I'll put some tickers here later this week to help keep track of Books finished Pages read Let the games begin!!!

Since I recently acquired a Kindle, I'll be reading much more. You can see what I read in 2010 and how I rated them here. Feel free to talk about those in this thread, too, if you want. Suggestions are always welcome. Please note that I'm not a librarian, nor am I an English major, nor have I been reading dozens of books yearly for several years. I'm only somebody who enjoys reading. So my 'reviews' are simply my thoughts, and they're not meant to be academically stunning or stupendously well-written. However, if you enjoy them, that's wonderful! And if you disagree, that's wonderful too, and please say so. Thoughtful discussion is always a good thing.",no

Simple directions for posting to the wiki can be found at the bottom of each month's wiki page.   ...logo by cyderry ------------------ Hi Challengers!  It will soon be a new year so here's what I hope to accomplish in 2011. Keep the TIOLI challenge a mystery! You should give out information and links to it - but ONLY if someone asks. The reason for this is to keep the TIOLI from becoming too large for me to manage and yet keep it an open group. In addition, please keep your challenges under wraps until the time the monthly TIOLI challenge is posted. Plan your creative challenges so most people will not be able to pre-plan their TIOLI reads ahead of time. This keeps the element of surprise within the challenges. Contrary to popular thought, all of your reads do NOT have to fit into a TIOLI slot, gang!! :) So here's what you've been waiting for... Your January 2011 challenge is to find and Read a 3.8 to 4.2 Star Book. The numbers refer to the star rating here on Librarything.  In order to know if a book is eligible for this challenge, look up its star rating first.  There are two ways to find a book's star rating:  1. On the work page of a single book: Just click on the books work page. The number (to two decimal places) is listed to the right of the stars.  2. On your personal Recommendation List: To get there, click on the Profile tab. Then click on the Recommendations sub-heading. The books you see listed there are recommended to you and also give you star ratings. Simply pick a book thats rated from 3.80 to 4.20. Thats so easy!!    Add the star rating to the book information as you post your book, using this format: The Hungry Tide (3.92)  Amitav Ghosh  SqueakyChu Once your book is posted, you no longer need to check its star rating. It will remain qualified once posted, even if the star rating later drops below or exceeds the parameters. Do NOT change the star rating once you post it. No, you may NOT add a book rated at 4.21 or higher (4.20 is the maximum). FYI: Matching books need not have the same star rating, but they MUST be within the parameters set by this challenge. Ready? Have fun with this and have a fabulous New Year! P.S. Please note: Wiki index is in Message #2 below. ----------------- Other Fun Stuff (not part of the TIOLI challenge): 1.

105999,"I've always enjoyed books set in far-flung places . Figured the start of a new year was a good time to set up a thread recording the exotic fiction titles I finish. My particular rules: (1) The setting counts rather than the author. Once I tried reading books by authors from such-and-such a country and it was frustrating because most of them moved to the US, UK, or Canada. (2) I will read in an order that roughly follows a west-east direction, passing over some countries, and then go around the world again once I get back to my starting point. Perhaps I'll read books from new countries; perhaps revisit previous places. (3) My starting point is south Texas, because that's where I grew up (and I never get tired of reading about the southern and southwestern US, Mexico, and the Caribbean).

It turned out to be a year of unemployment and poverty when I discovered my car was irreparable in April, and I had no way of fixing or replacing it. But it was also the year I discovered the 75 group, and all the kind people who fill it. It was the first year I felt comfortable openly discussing my social anxieties, and the year I found a group of sentimental people who actually gave a damn. Oh, and I had a tooth extracted. Fun. May 2011 see further progress. For me it is filled with hope for success and positivity, and I look forward to developing a life outside of the walls I have enclosed myself in.

106176,"'Termination Dust' is the second book in ""Sue Henry""'s series on Jessie Arnold, set in Alaska. This book is set in the Yukon, ok, it isn't Alaska. When the book opens, Jim Hampton is kayaking in the Yukon River. En route, he discovers a body and a few artifacts dating back to the 1890s. Among these items, is a diary of a gold miner heading for the Klondike gold rush and a few nuggets of gold. Part of this book is uncovering the events of the miner and what became of his gold.  Next, Jim is attacked by two men in a zodiac who destroy his kayak and steal his gear. Jim makes camp, but when he wakes, there are two policemen, a dead body, and most of his gear is back. All the evidence points to Jim as the murderer, but he has no motive.  Termination dust is an Alaskan term for the first light dusting of snow on the mountains. This is taken as a sign of the big snows to come. Both stories see this moment come and pass.  I enjoyed the story a lot, but felt it could have been more. I kept expecting more from the historical story. It was pretty obvious who dunnit, especially that Jim hadn't. And the evidence seemed to hinge a lot on a simple error by the guilty. But it is still a very enjoyable read.  As a bonus, the last chapter of the book is the full diary of the gold miner, Addison Harley Riser. It is an enjoyable tale in its own right.",no

Thus, I include it here for the completeness of my incompleteness, as it were. ++The Tiger's Wife (120/338) Dunno. Couldn't quite stay in it. LW3 loved this, so I suspect strongly I will be giving it another go. ++The Goldbug Variations (25/639) Slumpies. ++Winter's Tale (68/748) A victim of the Dreaded Slumpies.  --A Discovery of Witches (104/579) Somewhat intriguing, but not really holding my interest.  ++The Magicians (90/402) Slumpies. Coming back to this one some time for sure, as was intrigued by the set-up. ++The Green Knight (42/472) A victim of the Dreaded Slumpies. ++John Adams (103/651) I got all excited to read this after seeing the miniseries based on it, and then lost steam with it, sort of feeling like I had just seen it all, as it were. Will come back to it some time, though, as McCullough is aces. ++The Secret History of Fantasy (124/379; 8/19 stories) An anthology of fantasy short stories which is rather less exciting than I thought it would be, probably because I (inexplicably) expected it to be an anthology of essays about fantasy. *Clarissa (132/1499) I was determined this time to get through it, and gave it a dashed good go for about a week and a half. Despite rather liking it, I just can't keep my mind in it. I may renew the effort. I have yet to figure the best way. Five pages a day, religiously? Just bury one's self in it? Dip in several times a week for an hour or so each time?  ~2xStranger in a Strange Land (206/438) I've read Stranger before and had the itch to reread it. But I need to be in just the right mood for Heinlein; otherwise he rubs me the wrong way. I started to get rubbed the wrong way at the midpoint and put it down rather than get out of sorts with it, as out of sorts with Heinlein is no way to be. --The Women's Room (107/465) The writing was engaging and the subject matter fascinating, but the book depressed me so horribly that I couldn't carry on with it. ++Mansfield Park (68/473) A Dreaded Slumpies contender. Alas.  ++Glory Season (74/772) An attempt to break the Dreaded Slumpies. Enjoyable, but didn't do the trick. ++Angle of Repose (172/557) A victim of the Dreaded Slumpies. I was quite enjoying this, but just couldn't keep my head in it. Would very much like to finish it, but fear I've been away too long to pick up the threads now without starting over. --Let Me In (35/472) Waaaay too dark and disturbing. Which is disappointing, because I am intrigued by everything I've heard about this book. I may give it another go some other time, but for now I got a decided gut feeling that reading this was not a good move for me right now. ~2xAnimal Vegetable Miracle (174/354) I've read this before, and picked it up on a whim. When the whim withered, I saw no reason why I ought keep going. Probably will finish the reread at some point, but no immediate plans to do so. --The House at Riverton (~142/472) This seemed the perfect thing to scratch the ""mysterious goings on at an English house in a historical period"" itch I had going, but the (striking) similarities to particular scenes in Upstairs, Downstairs turned me off. ++Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell (~118/847) I suspect I put this down because the book was literally too heavy. Got to steal my book pillow back from the cat.  ++Fifth Business (104/257) The biggest casualty of the move, as I was thoroughly caught up in it and then it got packed onto the moving truck accidentally. Three weeks later when I found it again, I'd moved on. Will return to it. ~2xFirst Frontier (142/383) A Star Trek book I'd read before. A comfortable diversion during the move that I never got around to finishing. ++Between the Acts (46/219) I started this just before the move hoping to finish it before the chaos ensued. But I didn't, and it's impossible to read Woolf in the midst of a flurry, I find. Someday I'll return to it and just start over. *Mr Darcy Takes a Wife (148/465) The first in a series of casualties from the move. The shuffling of life and possessions led to the shuffling of reads, it seems. I was enjoying this in all its ridiculousness, so I may return to it. --Guenevere: Queen of the Summer Country (46/424) Another Arthurian retelling that wasn't grabbing me. I like this one's notion of Guenevere as someone important and powerful in her own right, but the characters read flat and nothing about the actual telling of the story was interesting. I may just have to start rereading The Mists of Avalon every three or four years. --The Hawk of May (144/313) In the mood for some good Arthurian whatnot, as M and I are currently working through season two of Merlin. But this wasn't quite hitting the spot, somehow. *The Historian (146/909) I was very caught up in this, to the tune of an unsettled feeling and nightmares. Which I'm not in the mood for just now. ++The Blind Assassin (84/513) Intended to read this along with the 1book140 Twitter book club, but I quickly realized that I really didn't want to discuss this book bit by bit. That realization somehow led to me putting down the book I was otherwise enjoying?  *Game of Thrones (272/807) Is good, but one particularly grim scene put me off it for now. I suspect strongly that I'll be back when I feel a bit more settled myself. (EDIT: Read ~150 pages after initially putting it down. I just can't quite settle into it.) ++Tooth and Claw (86/292) I'll be back to this one. ++The Two Towers (93/412) I had a notion I was going to read all of LotR and then got interested in other things. This has happened before, of course, and is why I've read Fellowship so many more times than Towers and King. And, of course, I will finish it someday. ++A Suitable Boy (108/1474) I was loving this but kept being pulled away to other reads. Will return to it when I've cleared out some other reads distracting me from it. --A Short History of World War II (94/389) I was finding this rough going and hard to keep up with given everything else I was reading. I'll most likely return to it eventually as I still want to read up on WWII. ~2xThe Language Instinct (159/448) I've read it before, and the first third adequately scratched my language science itch for now. --Murder with Peacocks (12/332) Picked this up on a whim at the library having heard some generally favorable things. It didn't grab me, so in a move entirely untrue to form, I nixed it quick. ++The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (128/607) I have not, not given up on this. It was just that so many other things were calling to me just now. (EDIT: Okay, maybe have given up. Give it a fresh go another time.) ~2xThe House on the Strand (97/336) The narrator makes me cross and the story just wasn't grabbing me in the way I know du Maurier can.  ++The Wings of the Dove (40/492) Surprisingly intrigued as James usually makes me want to put finger in eye. --Star Trek: Spectre (106/372) Am seriously annoyed by off characterizations of some key Trek characters. ++Angelology (182/452) No idea why I put this down, as it's pretty awesome. ++The Silmarillion (38/304) Fascinated, but was simply not in the right mood. --South of Broad (196/514) The huge leap forward in time has thrown me out of the story. --Holy Blood, Holy Grail (111/438) It meanders? Or I am just too distracted by the less-than-stellar scholarship? --The Children's Book (182/675) The style became wearing. --The Little Princess (65/202) Something truly awful happened and I couldn't bear to keep going. *Outlander (344/850) Was enjoying this; not sure why I stopped. Intend to continue. (EDIT: I did continue, for another ~150 pages. Enjoyed it some more. Stopped again. I suspect this is how it will go with Gabaldon: I'll be in the mood and read a bit, then quit, then come back, and so on.) ----- In 2010 I found myself choosing books to read based on how close I was to my 75-book goal. While I did not often choose a short book to pad numbers, I did frequently avoid big or dense books out of fear that they would slow me down. Having met the ""challenge"" in 2010, this year I will keep track of what I've read but forgo counting throughout the year in an effort to keep myself from censoring my reads this way. If I want to read Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, by golly, I'll do it. And if it takes three months, well fine. If nothing else but A Suitable Boy will suit, great! and who cares if I could have read six shorter books in the time it takes to do it. If I have a sudden need to read three Star Trek novels in a row despite already being half-way through two literary reads, that's no reason to feel guilty. In 2010, I fully and completely reclaimed reading as a pleasure (grad school in English, rather than making work seem fun, turns fun into work); in 2011, I will stop making reading an obligation. So.

Don't get me wrong, I certainly kept reading last year... just sat back and didn't participate. I have decided participating is WAY better! So here we go... glad to see so many people in the group... some old, some new. 1. Fated by S.G.Browne This was my first time reading this author, but it certainly won't be my last. This book made me laugh out loud while reading in bed, much to my husband's irritation! Fate, who goes by the name Fabio, is bored with his job. He has been doing it for thousands of years after all, and on top of that humans rarely even live up to the meager fates he chooses for them. Then one day he meets a mortal woman and falls in love. This is of course absolutely not allowed... and so the conflict begins. I found this one of the most delightfully humorous, light-hearted books I have read in a long time. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the writing style. The author doesn't take himself too seriously, and it makes for a purely fun read. I highly recommend it! ",no

Short review: A seemingly scientology-influenced work of mediocrity that somehow won the 1955 Hugo for Best Novel. Long review: After awarding the Hugo Award to The Demolished Man in 1953, the award was temporarily retired. Apparently everyone thought that the Hugos awarded at the 1953 Worldcon would be a one-time event as opposed to an annual affair. In 1955 the award was brought back after its short hiatus and the Best Novel Hugo was inexplicably awarded to They'd Rather Be Right (later renamed The Forever Machine). Why this turgid and pointless work of mediocrity won the Hugo remains a mystery, especially given that there were numerous far-superior alternatives available including Brain Wave by Poul Anderson, The Caves of Steel by Isaac Asimov, Earthman, Come Home by James Blish, Mission of Gravity by Hal Clement, and The Star Beast by Robert Heinlein. Hugo voters could have followed the International Fantasy Award and voted in favor of Edgar Pangborn's A Mirror for Observers. Or they could have even selected The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien. But no, they elected to choose a book so weak that it is the only Hugo winning novel to be allowed to go out of print for decades. (Note: In 1955 the selection process appears not to have been formalized fully, so there was no short list of competing nominees, this selection potential alternative winners is merely drawn from the array of other works of science fiction and fantasy published in 1955). One odd side effect of They'd Rather Be Right's Hugo win is that every now and then, when some enterprising writer decides to plunge into science fiction and read all the Hugo winners, they plough through the excellent 1953 winner The Demolished Man, write glowing praise for it, and then are never heard from again on the subject of science fiction. I am guessing that it is because they move on to this example of lousy writing and lose their verve. The story of They'd Rather Be Right is pretty straightforward, which is actually part of the problem with the book. A group of scientists create a thinking machine they call ""Bossy"", which causes public panic as everyone thinks that the machine will relegate humans to second class status. On that note, one has to wonder what sort of public relations failure one would have to engage in to name your thinking machine ""Bossy"" in the face of a panicky public. The novel opens with two of the scientists on the run, aided by a telepath named Joe Carter who hides them on skid row. They reassemble their machine and despite the fact that the machine was supposed to be designed to prevent airline crashes, they decide instead that the obvious thing to do is feed it a bunch of psychological data, hook it up to Mabel, their ex-prostitute landlady, and watch her become a young superpowered woman. If you think this doesn't make much sense, you're right. But the book was written to order as a serial appearing in Astounding Science Fiction for editor John Campbell, who by the time this work was being penned had already become a proponent of L. Ron Hubbard's ludicrously pseudoscientific Dianetics (going so far as to proclaim that Hubbard would win the Nobel Peace Prize for creating Scientology). How does this connect to They'd Rather Be Right one might ask. Well, when Bossy is connected to Mabel it ""cures"" her of old age by eliminating all of the false ideas she has, and replacing them with logical ones, leaving her more ethical, smarter, healthier, apparently immortal, and possessing of the power of telepathy. This process seems closely analogous with the Scientology practice of ""auditing"" a person to eliminate the ""reactive mind"" and ""thetans"", which proponents of Scientology claim will leave a person more ethical, more intelligent, immune to a host of illnesses, and eventually possessing of supernatural powers. This is not the only Scientology influenced element that the books seems to display. Hubbard's hatred of psychiatry is fairly public knowledge now, and it should come as no surprise that the sole psychiatrist character who appears in the novel is a dogmatic, venal character whose theories are quickly and easily dismissed by the clear-thinking Mabel. Whether Clifton and Riley inserted these sort of Scientology-like element as the centerpiece of their book because they were influenced by Hubbard, or influenced by the same sorts of popular thinking that inspired Hubbard, or simply because they knew that Campbell would like and and be more likely to buy their work, the fingerprints are there. The Scientology influence isn't all that drags this book into sub-mediocrity. Once Bossy has been assembled and its magical healing powers revealed, the plot, such as there is of one, just sort of peters out. Joe and the two professors turn to a wealthy industrialist for help in getting out from under Federal indictment because they assume that because he published an editorial in favor of Bossy he'd be sympathetic to their cause. And instead of any kind of plot twist developing, he is wholeheartedly on their side, even when it becomes apparent that he won't get what he wants out of the relationship. It turns out that one has to give up all of your prejudices and beliefs in order to benefit from the use of the machine, prompting Joe to state that most people wouldn't be willing to do this but would ""rather be right"". It also turns out that anyone who successfully goes through the procedure becomes telepathic, another development with hug potential implications that is left unexplored. Joe's aberrant telepathy is also a mystery, and since he is already a telepath, it seems that no one thinks that he should go through the Bossy based process. Apparently, if you are already a telepath, the possibility of becoming immortal isn't that enticing. Rather than examining what might happen if you had a society in which some people are effectively immortal and superpowered and others are not, the book ends just as the machines begin rolling off the assembly line. Instead of examining the effects of this sort of development, Clifton and Riley are pretty much content to have their cardboard characters lecture the reader about ""opinion control"" and give vague indications that the world is controlled by nebulous and yet pervasive public relations campaigns that, on a whim, can turn the populace on a dime. The one character who tries to undergo the process and fails simply resigns himself to the fact that he is destined to remain old and sick, which seems like an oddly listless reaction to what would probably be devastating news. This just highlights the fact that the ""character"" isn't really a character, but just a prop being used by the authors to make a point. Having made its argument in favor of Dianetics via computer interface, the book just ends. They'd Rather Be Right is widely regarded as the worst novel to ever win a Hugo Award. I'm not inclined to disagree with this assessment. Given that, it is not a terrible book, but rather a very formulaic piece of mediocre fiction overlaid with a veneer of poorly disguised Scientology. The book isn't even bad enough to be derided as enjoyably awful, it is just bland, dull, and uninteresting. Overall the experience of reading the tasteless blandness of They'd Rather Be Right is akin to eating stale white bread, and is an experience best to be avoided.

106368,"Time for a new thread! Below is a brief explanation of my reading habits, copied from the last thread. Happy reading everyone! Okay, be forewarned: I'm a bit neurotic about what I read and when. I love books (of course) and I love lists, so lists of books are heaven to me and nearly everything I read comes from some list or another, and there's some complex list-rotation involved as well. Here's my best effort to explain myself (if you're in no way interested, please to skip to the next post for my current reads): Usually I have about 8 books going at once, one each from the following groups (and occasional other books slipped in there too): 1. A library book. I'd tell you how I pick these, but it's too embarrassing. Maybe you'll figure it out as the year unfolds... 2. A book from the 100 Banned Books book (at least currently. As soon as I finish this list, I'll replace it with another, and oh, I've got tons of lists). 3. A children's book, for Charlie's library. I'm trying to collect books from various award lists, and I like reading them before reading them to Charlie. For this category, Im working through a few different lists: -NEH Timeless Classics list -Newbery Winners list -Caldecott Winners list -1001 Childrens Books You Must Read Before You Die -John Bellairs' bibliography -The Black Stallion books -The Beverly Cleary bibliography 4. Another children's book, this one read aloud during Charlie's bath-time. 5. A book from the Green Dragon 1001 Fantasy List, in chronological order. 6. A book for the Presidential Challenge. Books for this category are read in chronological (presidentially) order. 7. An audio book, which I listen to while I'm knitting/sewing/crafting 8. For this category, I cycle through 9 different stacks: -a. A book from my shelves which I haven't yet read -b. A CYOA book - I'm trying to collect as many of these as I can, again, for Charlie. -c. Agatha Christie's bibliography (in chronological order) -d. Stephen King's bibliography (in chronological order) -e. Neil Gaiman's bibliography (in some order other than chronological (don't ask)). -f. Christopher Moore's bibliography (in chronological order) -g. Stephen Fry's bibliography (in chronological order) -h. The National Book Award list (in alpha order by title) -i. The Pulizer list (in alpha order by author)",no

I'm not a huge reader of 'series' books, generally making it through the first one wanting more, the second one thinking it wasn't as good as the first, and the third one I might only make it halfway though.

The preponderance of self-identified atheists--and me too, although I don't always take the label--view themselves as a-theists: they reject the theist world-view. On the other hand, many people who are themselves theists prefer to construe atheists as what might be termed athe-ists: those whose world-view is defined by a rejection of God.

108072,"I'm rereading and enjoying Kitchen's Rommel's Desert War: Waging World War II in North Africa, an excellent single volume campaign history. I owe my fascination to this theater to a number of influences. Bookracks here and there offered Panzer Battles, Foxes of the Desert, and Alan Moorehead's desert volumes. Avalon Hill's wargame AKRIKA KORPS just sparked the flame. I discovered Brazen Chariots and I bought The Rommel Papers. Some drug store book rack had With Rommel in the Desert. I also discovered that wonderful (and inexpensive) series of WWII paperbacks from Ballantine...I had bookshelves full of them! Bir Hakim, Tobruk, the LRDG and on and on.  As i learned more I discovered that WWII generals sometimes fibbed and that their biographers (Liddell Hart etc) weren't always completely truthful either. This was the era I read Kenneth Macksey Rommel: Battles and Campaigns, Correlli Barnett Desert Generals and Ronald Lewin Rommel as Military Commander & The life and death of the Afrika Korps. I've continued on, picking up Barrie Pitt's trilogy: The Definitive History of the Desert War , the small but interesting Great Campaigns volume Rommel's North Africa Campaign: September 1940 - November 1942 as well as Rommel and the Secret War in North Africa, 1941-1943: Secret Intelligence in the North African Campaign.

108125,1. My first book for this year was The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield. Well actually started this just before christmas 2010 but finished it in January 2011. Excellent book - has inspired me to re-read Jane Eyre which I plan to do this year. A very haunting tale about twins. Vida Winter a famous writer looks back at her life and hires someone to write her biography. 2. The Bay at Midnight by Diane Chamberlain. Just wrote my first full review on Librarything about this one. Enjoyed but not as good as the Lost Daughter. This is about Isabel who is found dead presumed murdered in the bay and the events surrounding this. It is based in 1962 and present day.  3. in Office Hours by Lucy Kellaway. Just finished the ending left me feeling a little flat. I expected this to be a funny read with some real laugh out moments but there were not enough - and it was very predictable. It's about two lady's having office affairs. Not what I would normally pick as was a book club choice.,no

Before I even start this thread, I'd like to point out that I know, realistically, 75 books might more than I can even hope to shoot for this year. There's a lot going on, but I like having a goal like this. Having this at the back of my mind keeps me reading as much as possible. I'm also *slightly* embarrassed by some of the books that I haven't read yet. Some of my books are classics that as someone who holds a degree in English, I really should have read a dozen times by now. I'm hoping that by keeping an on-going list here, I'll be more inclined to keep up with my reading, even if I can't keep up with the other members who can read so many books so quickly. So, here it goes.  1.) Little Women by Louisa May Alcott (finished 1/1/11) 2.) Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (finished 1/12/11) 3.) Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden (finished 1/16/11) 4.)

I noticed a curious thing with some of my Easton Press editions from their ""Collector's Library of Famous Editions"". In some of them that are clearly reprints of the earlier LEC editions, they acknowledge the LEC on the copyright page. On others, such as The Idiot, they do not. The ""Notes from the Archives"" brochure that is tipped into the book discusses the illustrator Fritz Eichenberg, and the copyright page notes that the illustrations are copyright 1955. So clearly this is a reprint of the LEC. But they do not mention the LEC at all in the notes either.  I thought that EP owned the rights to all the older LEC/HP books. I'm not sure why they would not go out of their way to point out their relationship/evolution from such a prestigious press as the LEC. Strange.",no

The previous week's edition also had an article on a similar theme, this time discussing rape as a weapon of war.

I absolutely loved it. A very talented young author. February None. Boy I really slacked off this month. It must have been the new job. March 3. Playing President: My Relationships with Nixon, Carter, Bush I, Reagan, and Clinton --and How They Did Not Prepare Me for George W. Bush by Robert Sheer - This book was a real find at a local used bookstore. It provided fantastic insight into the personalities of many past Presidents. I thought his commentary on George W. Bush was a little overblown, but all in all it was a really interesting read. 4. By Nightfall by Michael Cunningham - This book was very disappointing. For a character driven novel, I was expecting more depth. Also, the realism of certain scenes was lacking. There were many parts of the book that caused me to roll my eyes and exclaim, ""Yeah, right."" Cunningham writes beautifully, but this book had very little plot and rather flimsy characters. April Reading 3 books - but I haven't finished any of them! May 5. The Given Day by Dennis Lehane - I loved this book. It held my interest the entire time. It's a great historical novel set in Boston during the Boston Police Strike of 1919. The characters are very engaging and the plot is excellent. Lehane's writing is a real treat. 6. A Reason to Believe: Lessons from an Improbable Life by Deval Patrick - A very inspirational book by the current Governor of Massachusetts. His journey was truly improbable and I loved reading about it. 7. Nixonland by Rick Perlstein - This book was too detailed and poorly written. It did not keep my attention and I was very disappointed. June 8. The Client by John Grisham - Great book! One of my favorite characters of all time is Reggie Love - the main character's attorney. I just loved her attitude and wit. Fantastic read. 9. The Girl Who Played with Fire by Stieg Larsson - Awesome. This series is fantastic. It's a shame that the author is no longer with us and can't enjoy his success and continue the tales of Lisbeth Salander. July 10. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest by Stieg Larsson - A perfect ending to a great series. I'm so disappointed that Mr. Larsson never saw the success of his books.

109410,I just finished reading Neptune's Inferno: The U.S. Navy at Guadalcanal by James D. Hornfischer about the South Pacific naval battles in 1942. I recommend the book highly. This was one of the fews campaigns where the U.S. and Japan were mostly at parity in forces. tactics and technology. The campaign became one huge slugfest between the surface fleets. It was also a very closely run thing with each side making catastrophic mistakes. The battle easily could have gone the other way for the U.S. Navy. That it ended in an American victory was due mostly to the aggressiveness and courage of most of the naval commanders and the resoluteness of the young sailors who did there jobs in the face of tremendous carnage. ,no

The 31-year-old columnist is already well known in her native Canada as an oft-accused and once-admitted stalker who made questionable rape charges of her own 10 years ago, in a case that eventually cut short the career of a university president and changed the tenor of harassment cases all over Canada. In 1999, a professor at the same university went to the police with charges Marsden was stalking him, and in 2004 she pleaded guilty to criminally harassing a former Vancouver radio host."" The first of her several cases, was, in effect, our own version of the Duke lacrosse fiasco. If FOX really did do their due diligence before hiring her, their Human Resources Department must be insane, or just playing a cruel joke on someone.

I've been working on it since last year, even though my husband gave it to me in 2006 when we were dating. TvTropes would call the series a door stop. Since then, I've read all of the Mercy Thompson novels, and I'm waiting for the latest Sevenwaters book to come out in paperback. Yeah, my well's been pretty dry, mostly because I've let it dry up. Perhaps a reading journal will get me back on track. Sci-fi, Fantasy, historical fiction, or non-fiction, perhaps if I keep a log of books that I read for pleasure, I can get myself back on track.

110649,"I was told by two friends separately that I might like Tamora Pierce last year so I just not got around to reading her things. Because they are young adult and children's novels, they are quick reads, so I started with the first series, the Song of the Lioness quartet. Alanna: The First Adventure was a good start, so I read the others, In the Hand of the Goddess, The Woman Who Rides Like A Man, and Lioness Rampant. I liked the premise, and I wish I had read this stuff earlier. I know I would have liked it when I was younger, it probably would have meant more. Now, it is fun and engaging, but not exactly revelatory. Well, it didn't take long to read, and I wondered where else she would go, so I continued to read. Next was another series set in the same world as Alanna's, but a few years later. The Immortals quartet: Wild Magic, Wolf-Speaker, The Emperor Mage, and The Realms of the Gods. Again Pierce delved into magic and difficulties of a nation set upon by several large problems. I like that Pierce doesn't avoid such problems as war, hunger, poverty, and intricate socio-political issues. I find her novels to be fast paced enough that most youth reading them, I would imagine, could keep up withouth getting bored. I liked that magic has a history and rules, but some things fall outside of their traditional boundaries.  I liked it all so far, so I kept on reading. Next was the Protector of the Small series. Again in the same world, another lady knight series, but this one had no magic unlike Alanna. The First Test was a little slow, but I liked the rest of the series better. Page, Squire, and Lady Knight were all solid writing. I thought they were the best I had seen so far of her work. In this case, the bad guys were again scary, even more so than usual. The war was harsh, the lessons learned sometimes gruelling.  I went on to the Trickster novels, Trickster's Choice and Trickster's Queen both solid work. Different style than previous novels, but set in the same world, indeed, the main character is Alanna's daughter, and a very tricksy character is made. I thought her version of a Trickster god was very convincing and appealing as much as he was scary. I liked the new politics of the islands off the mainland, and the diverse and troublesome politics engendered. Highly recommended. These are written for youths a bit older, and on up, I think most fantasy fans would appreciate the Trickster novels.  I followed up the Tortall world with the Beka Cooper books, set a couple of hundred years before the Alanna books. Terrier and Bloodhound were stunningly good. Mastiff is set to be published in 2011, and I'm looking forward to it. Pierce manages to set up novels about solid city policing in a world of magic and low technology where previously she favored tricksters and thieves. Very successful turnaround, and the voice of the diary-styled book was different, solid, and clear. Again, written for older youths, most folks would probably enjoy them.  I've lately been reading the Circle books, first the Circle of Magic Sandry's Book, Daja's Book, Tris's Book and Briar's Book and will next read the Circle Opens sequel series. Not in the world of Tortall, another fantasy series had begun. The magic seems to be different, but again addressed the issue of what may happen should an established group of magicians run into non-traditional magic. Back to slightly younger characters and voice, the books go quick, and have smart characters and solid plots. I will no doubt read every book Pierce has written, and look forward to more.   So look around and read a few reviews to see if you might this author, or just jump in and have fun!   I'm sure I read more than 75 books a year, but I have not kept track, so perhaps I'm wrong. I guess I shall see.",no
110741,"In the announcement thread in the New Features group we already discussed how the Contains relationship should affect your recommendations and other features like Members With Your Books (MWYB) and checkmarks but the other relationships should matter too. For example, in this thread, http://www.librarything.com/topic/110645, it was mentioned that in books where later editions add material but don't rewrite the existing material that we generally combine them. But with the new Expands relationship maybe we should separate them but I'd still want there to be a social connection between owners of the different works. Maybe somebody who owns an expanded edition shouldn't be connected as strongly to the owner of the original work, so perhaps for recommendations they should only be counted as half-strength. MWYB is more tricky. Should the book be shown as shared if it's really only connected with an Expanded relationship? Probably not, but what if it were in the MWYB list in italics? The above should also apply to all the other relationships as well, I think, but maybe the Inspired relationship should be much more tenuous than the Expanded relationship, for example.",no

11208,"This thread is a spin-off from a side-discussion in the only other (at this point) thread, where it was suggested it was a distraction from that other thread's main subject. In that thread a book entitled Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or to Succeed  by the author Jared Diamond was favorably quoted, and I replied, ""(And I am shocked to see a liberal recommending favorably a book by Jared Diamond, whose views on racial superiority in intelligence, I should have thought, would have placed him beyond the pale.)"" I must admit I was teasing just a bit here, since I think a lot of Diamond, especially his Guns, Germs, and Steel, which raises very important issues about the ""long view"" of human development which I believe must inform all of our political thinking. Anyway, LolaWalser asked "" From where do you get this?"" and I promised to find the relevant quotes when I returned home and had access to my library. Further exchanges went like this: Lola My goodness, shocking ""pages"" of racist stuff in a Pulitzer-winning bestseller that no one until you has noticed! :) It's been years since I read it, but I'll wager you seriously misunderstood him. Me: Lola: Yes, of course I may have mis-read what he said. You can decide when I provide the quotes. But on the other hand, perhaps his racialist speculations were overlooked, or looked upon benevolently, because they implicitly attacked a race that most of his readers despise. (The ""cancer of humanity"" one prominent intellectual called it.) And by ""pages"", I meant that the relevant material is, on my edition, spread over two pages. And it is not a major thesis, just a casual observation. On the other hand, it does definitely undermine the Dogma of the Blank Slate (all races and both sexes are absolutely equal in cognitive capacity -- all perceived differences must be due to the social environment). So I was surprised to see it pass without comment. But before that happened, Lola apparently found the relevant passages, and interpreted them like this: Lola Yes, now I'm certain you misunderstood him. While it may seem reckless to go out on a limb trying to guess which parts of the book you had in mind, I don't see that I have much choice, as I'd like to wrap up quickly and get this digression out of the way of the larger discussion. So I'm going to venture a guess that it's in the very beginning, when Diamond speculates about (modern) New Guineans being mentally MORE able than (modern) Westerners. He bases this on his observation of their intellectual alertness and curiosity and contrasts this with (also his observation) the relative sluggishness and intellectual passivity of the Westerners. Well, Diamond is a evolutionary biologist, interested in adaptations, and he proceeds to speculate that New Guineans exhibit these heightened-mental-activity traits in response to their environment, which presents them with constant and varied challenges. Briefly, there is less routine in the jungle than in the life of a couch potato. Now, the question of whether New Guineans are ""smarter"" than the Westerners, isn't the one Diamond is posing or is interested in answering at all--he observed (correctly or not, but since HE lived there 33 years I'm inclined to believe at least his description of their abilities) a difference, and used his observation as a springboard for explaining differences in human societies in the evolutionary context, as adaptations to specific circumstances. In fact, his entire main argument, the explanation of differences in human societies in terms of the environment and chance goes AGAINST racism, is the very opposite of its essentialism and fatalism! This is so glaring you must forgive me if I say it makes your misunderstanding positively comical. Racism posits inherent unchangeable differences in so-called human ""races"": blacks were ever and ever will be (mentally etc.) inferior. Or, Jews were ever and ever will be superior. Diamond, otoh, speculates how unique human intelligence--a flexible, develop-able, changeable, pan-human trait--adapted to the original (and in many cases still present) specific constraints of the biogeographical and historical circumstances in Australia, Europe, New Guinea, the Fertile Crescent, Mesoamerica and so on. I hope this might help you to reconsider some of your conclusions, but if you wish to continue the discussion, perhaps we could start another thread so as not to derange the rest. And so here we are! So let's see what we agree on: (1) Diamond observes that New Guineans are more intelligent than Westerners, in some respects at least. As he puts it: ""From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is. At some tasks that one might reasonably suppose to reflect aspects of brain function, such as the ability to form a mental map of unfamiliar surroundings, they appear considerably more adept than Westerners."" (2) He also notes that it is difficult to separate ""innate"" (a synonym, I take it, for ""genetic"") differences in intelligence from those induced by differences in the childhood ""social environment"". (3) And he asserts that ""tests of cognitive ability (like IQ tests) tend to measure cultural learning, and not pure innate intelligence, whatever that is"". (Which does not keep him, quite rightly, from using the term ""intelligence"" without qualification elsewhere in his writing, since he and his readers know that there is indeed such a thing, even if it hard to pin down.) (All the previous quotes and summaries are from page 20 of my version -- the Vintage paperback -- of Guns, Germs and Steel.) Okay, so far this is just the Conventional Wisdom of American academia, deviated from at your peril if you are an academic and want to be in the club. So, is he simply saying that the different social (or other) environment in New Guinea has caused New Guinean superiority in various cognitive functions, but that this has, of course, no genetic basis? (And anyway, ""intelligence"" is a problematic term?) This is what Lola asserts: their environment has given them this superiority. That is, unlike, say, their skin color, the New Guineans' superior intelligence is not something that is biologically-rooted, and thus not passable to the next generations in ways other than culture, and thus something that non-New Guneans could potentially pick up if they were raised in the same environment -- ""trained from childhood"" as he puts it? If so, what are we to make of the following quote, on the succeeding page, where we read (my emphasis): ""Intelligent people are likelier than less intelligent ones to escape those causes of high mortality in traditional New Guinea societies. However, the differential mortality from epidemic diseases in traditional European society had little to do with intelligence, and instead involved genetic resistance dependent on details of body chemistry. For example, people with blood group B or O have a greater resistance to smallpox than people with blood group A. That is, natural selection promoting genes for intelligence has probably been far more ruthless in New Guinea than in more densely populated, politically complex societies, where natural selection for body chemistry was instead more potent. Besides this genetic reason, there is also a second reason why New Guineans may have come to be smarter than Westerners."" (Diamond goes on to blame the large amount of time European and American children spend in consuming passive entertainment, as contrasted with the active lives of New Guinea children, and then refers to child development studies which ""stress the irreversible mental stunting associated with reduced childhood stimulation."" I am skeptical about the validity of the latter assertion, which I believe is shallow pop psychology, but that's another issue.) He concludes this paragraph by saying ""This effect surely contribues a non-genetic component to the superior average mental function displayed by New Guineans."" And he writes in the immediately following paragraph: ""That is, in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners, and they surely are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up."" To summarize: Diamond believes that  (1) New Guineans are ""superior to Westerners in mental ability"" -- as are in fact other (non-white) groups: elsewhere (page 19) he says that ""modern 'Stone Age' peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples... white immigrants to Australia do not deserve the credit usually accorded to them for building a literate industrialized society.."" (2) This ""superior average mental function"" has two causes: (a) It is ""probably"" genetic, caused by different evolutionary selection pressures on Stone Age as opposed to European populations. (b) It is also, more certainly, caused by the better childhood environment, from the viewpoint of cognitive development, enjoyed by the children of these Stone Age peoples. Now is not (a) an argument for a possible genetic component superior cognitive functioning, the exact symmetric equivalent of, say, The Bell Curve/s arguments about African-descended people? Lola reads this and sees only (b)-- but (a) is there too. Please note that I do not say it is wrong for that reason. Diamond may be right. Maybe intelligence, or some kinds of intelligence, is genetically-based, and maybe Europeans and their descendants are inferior in some aspects of cognition due to the different selection pressures they were under. That is a matter for further research, since there seems to me to be powerful arguments for both sides. I have no opinion on this issue (nor on the related issue of innate sexual differences in cognitive capacity) because it far beyond my expertise. The truth will gradually emerge, eventually, however unpleasant. But just imagine if Diamond had concluded the opposite! Suppose he had written that his many years living with the New Guineans had convinced him that their mental functioning, in some aspects at least, was inferior to Westerners, certainly because of their inferior childhood experiences, and probably because of their genetic inferiority. Can you imagine the reaction from American Academia, and its Thought Policemen at all levels? His person would have been threatened, his classes disrupted, his book would probably not have found a publisher, much less won a Pulitzer Prize. He might even have been standing in the unemployment queue along with Larry Summers. So why is it that liberals just erase these words as they read Diamond, who is actually quite clear about his belief in the probable genetic roots of non-white mental superiority? What are the mental rationalizations through which they go? I don't have an explanation, just some observations: (1)Many Leftists (who tend to make the most noise on this issue) have a deep hatred, or at least disdain, for the white race -- Susan Sontag once called it ""the cancer of humanity"". So anti-white racism tends to get a pass. Racism can only be racism against non-whites, in their view. (2) Perhaps they believe that Diamond was writing tongue-in-cheek, teasing us with a ""reverse racist"" argument in which he really does not believe? I have considered that possibility -- it's an approach to dialogue to which I am susceptible myself -- but if he is being ironic, he is concealing it very well. (3) But I believe liberals and Leftists just blank out the plain meaning of these passages using the same mental process for suppressing cognitive dissonance that fundamentalist Christians use when confronted with, say, texts from the New Testament forbidding divorce except where one partner has committed ""fornication"".  They just don't want to accept what is plainly in front of their eyes, so ... they don't. Easy. One other thought: maybe he is subtly trying to undermine the Thought Policemen's attempt to enforce the Standard Social Science Model of the ""Blank Slate"" -- if he can slip in the possibility that intelligence, or certain aspects of it, is genetically-rooted, then the principle is established, for further exploration.  That doesn't seem likely to me, but it's a possibility. Psychologists love to regale us with stories of experiments designed to show how we refuse to process information that does not fit our preconceptions of what we should be seeing. (I think one such experiment has a man in a gorilla suit run through a basketball game which is being observed by subjects who are tasked to count the number of times the ball is passed. When questioned later, most of these observers cannot remember seeing anything unusual.) Diamond's argument for the probable genetic basis for superior intelligence is the man in the gorilla suit, so far as his liberal readers are concerned. Comic? Depends on your point of view. I can laugh at it, but I also remind myself that I am probably guilty of the same error somewhere else.",no

With trials and tribulations enough to make Job's miseries seem almost trivial in comparison, this intrepid trio face incredible odds against survival while their Christian faith stays strong, at least for two of them. The third member of the party will come to it but has two injured ""girls"" to rescue off one of the highest, steepest mountains in Denali park in an Alaskan winter, all the while being pursued by terrorists who are looking for something they believe the mother has information on, and then to leave no witnesses alive. They are out to kill these three and they are very good at what they do, leaving no trace. This book is a wonderful story of faith and survival, but it is also full of tips for survival woven into the story, and an awareness of a rare neural disorder that can be deadly in a matter of moments, a disorder that one of the authors actually suffers from. I was aware of this disorder, but learned more for which I'm grateful to the authors. So, we have a mixed bag in this book Terrorists, a man who has lost too much in his life and must learn to live again, a fast-paced, wild ride of a thriller, a 12 year old girl, Andie, with a rare disorder of unimaginable consequences, families disrupted by death, a love story, and deep, inspiring faith.  What sounds like a very complicated story is actually a book that I couldn't put down. Action-packed from the moment the plane they were flying home in is sabotaged and crashes high on Sultana Mountain to the final murderous attempt. The plane was originally owned by Andi's father Marc until his murder, and now is owned by her mother, Jenna. It was flown by Hank, a ""trusted"" friend of Marc and Jenna prior to Marc's death. Who was the mysterious last minute passenger? After he took over piloting the plane when the radio was shot out, what caused him to pass out? Was he responsible for the crash or was he trying to correct the damage? Can Jenna and Andie trust him? When Jenna took over piloting she realized that none of the controls were responding. That there would be a crash was inevitable. I took away so much more from the book than just a great story. Living in the north myself, I found the survival techniques very useful, especially how to keep warm through the bitterly cold nights and what to have with you for survival preparation. I also took away a refreshing of my faith. I applaud the authors for the smoothness with which they wrote this book, the interaction of the characters, more noticeable because of the manner in which the chapters are written, the heart-pounding action, the exciting plot, and pulling it all together so believably. The chapters are told mostly by the three main characters in the first person, almost giving a feeling that the reader is invested in the story.

So last year I tried to reach this goal - more out of fun than anything else, and I didn't really pressure myself to actually reach fifty. It was more just a reason to write down the things that I read, and consequently I only read twenty-seven books in 2010.  But by the end of the year, I felt sort of mediocre, and I decided to try it again in 2011, and try harder. It's going alright, so far. I've kind of hit a rough patch; I've only read about two or three books since late February/early March, so I need to pick myself up and get a move on.

It's Kind of a Funny Story by Ned Vizzini 5. The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath 6. Starter for Ten by David Nicholls 7. Matched by Ally Condie 8. Fire by Kristin Cashore Ouch. Typed out, this is a pretty weak list. Granted, I've also read several books for English, but I've decided not to include them, because I feel like that's kind of cheating. Regardless, I'm going to have to read a little more than five books a month from now on in order to reach fifty by 2012.  Oh, boy. This is quite the endeavor.

Or better yet (for my purposes) the few other characters that are in the novel are barely developed at all due to a severe lack of individual motivation. I think I've read some Bradbury short stories like this but I'm looking for a real sense of detached isolation if that makes sense. While I'm down with 1st person suggestions (for later) I'm really looking for 3rd. I'm wondering if it can be done without being painfully redundant.

And I've got a good first book to launch it off with, too: 51. A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts by Andrew Chaikin  Andrew Chaikin's detailed account of the Apollo space program focuses as much or more on the experiences, thoughts and reactions of the people involved than on the technical details, drawing on extensive interviews with astronauts and others to bring those experiences to life. At 600+ pages, it might be a little slow in places, but the descriptions of the missions themselves, which make up the bulk of the book, are vivid and exciting, at least to a lifelong space enthusiast like me. The sheer, marvelous audacity of the whole enterprise comes across very well, leading me several times to look up from the book, lean back and shake my head thinking, ""This is surely the craziest, most improbable, most wonderful thing we human beings have ever done!"" But more than that, Chaikin manages to effectively convey the simple reality of it all. These astronauts, we are reminded, were just ordinary guys -- well, all right, perhaps slightly extraordinary guys -- walking around a real and solid landscape cracking jokes, getting excited about interesting rocks, cursing at uncooperative equipment, and falling victim to that ""so much to do, so little time!"" feeling familiar to anyone who's ever over-scheduled a vacation. The you-are-there feeling of real people doing real things is sometimes almost overwhelming. Unfortunately, so is the sense of sadness at the thought that it's been a terribly long time since anyone's done anything at all on the moon, however optimistic Chaikin might try to be about the possible future of space exploration. I've read quite a few books on this period in the American space program, from the excellent to the terrible; this is one of the ones I would most highly recommend. Rating: 4.5/5. I actually came very close to giving it a 5/5, but I admit that's probably mainly because I'm unbelievably sentimental about this particular subject.",no

The story was so interesting and actually had a lot of humor in it even though it was about a modern day young woman who was killed in a bus accident and was given the opportunity to take the place of another young mother who had died. The woman she took the place of lived in an earlier time when there wasn't plumbing or modern conveniences. A fairy godmother of sorts explained the exchange and gave her a 'trial' period to see if she really wanted to stay. It was a difficult transition for the woman as she had never been married or had children but was taking the place of a woman with children who had also just given birth and was nursing her baby. The woman slowly became attached to the children and despite the hardships of living in an earlier time, chose to stay on as the young mother and wife.

And so, I offer Year Four of Katie's 50 book challenge: 1. Olive Kitteridge - Elizabeth Strout  - Can't remember where I heard about this book, but I was delighted to discover that it is an extremely well written and subtle story, driven by refreshingly real characters, although the realness became a bit frustrating at times. A surprisingly fast read. 2. Welcome to Camp Nightmare - RL Stine  - I was a Goosebumps freak when I was in 2nd grade & so I decided to indulge my silly side and read a few of my favorite GB books.

I'm sure she felt so alone, it would have helped to know how many other women had been in he same circumstances - told for their whole pregnancy that they were not fit to be a mother then expected to be a fine mother later when their sex was ""official"". My aunt's was maybe worse than most because she was gay. I remember her being very out and butch, but I wonder if giving up her daughter made her give up all other social conventions. She lived in a small town, I would have thought she'd try to hide her orientation, but she absolutely didn't. Anyway, a couple of quotes from the book that reminded me of her: There were several women in the book who told about their overwhelming life long anger. Here's one: I think this whole experience has made me incredibly strong. But if I had not been reunited with my daughter, I don't think it would have made me strong. I think I would have continued to be very, very, very angry until I died of a heart attack. Which my aunt did. She never reunited with her daughter and died in her 40's of a heart attack probably related to alcoholism. and another comment from the same woman  Listen, you know, I've gotten to the point in my life that when I see something that I really long for, I know it's not for me. That's when I realized what losing her had done. My experience was...that what I wanted was going to be held up in front of me and I was going to look at it but I could never have it.

Here, Home, Hope - a fun read, but not much depth to the story. Leverage Point - an examination of what motivates change, cleverly written into a compelling fictional story. Invisible - having an older main character give this cozy mystery a bit of a twist. Getting Away is Deadly - this is another cozy mystery series where the protagonist is a military wife. Life From Scratch - has a bit of Julie and Julia feel to it, but I liked watching the main character discover what it means to be in a relationship.

AND LET'S PRETEND THAT HER OTHER FRIEND THAT HELPS HER OUT IS DREW. I had to caps lock that for people to notice that. Summary  When Caitlin was small, she almost drowned. Ever since then, things seemed more sharp. She could read some people's minds and have dreams about the past, present or future. She had a best friend named Emily. They were complete opposites. She never really cared about her though. But Emily did.   And one day, when she goes missing, it's up to Caitlin and Drew to find out what happened to her. As Caitlin tries to find out what happened, she ventured into a past of kidnapping, other disappearences, and gifted people. Was this getting too dangerous? She kept thinking to herself.   One night, she had a dream that a girl was sitting on a bench. She looked like she was waiting for someone. Someone came up to her and led her somewhere else. The girl was being kidnapped. NOOO!!!! Caitlin screamed at the girl. But it was useless.   Caitlin and Drew went to the place to try and prevent that from happening to the girl. By the time they realized that the girl she dreamed about was Caitlin, it was too late. She got led to a place where other people were. Caitlin found out later that these were gifted people. And Emily was here. Thank god that she was here! But it seems like Emily changed. She was like a soul-less person.   They just had to escape! They just had to! Caitlin kept thinking to herself. With perseverence and a lot of luck, she convinced most of the people who were there to think of a plan to escape. And they finally thought of one.They escaped and most of the gifted people who got kidnapped became famous. Especially Caitlin. There are some other parts that MIGHT be part of the story too. 1) The place that they were brought to was a house. Maybe log? 2) The house got burned when they escaped. Along with the person who kidnapped them. Probably yeah. 3) The kidnapper was also a genious? Maybe... 4) The kidnapper was YOUNG. About the same age as Caitlin. Probably... 5) One of the things that ""Caitlin"" found out was this picture.A kid had this picture with a bunch of kids with Emily in it. Summer camp picture maybe? But later Emily vanishes from the picture...Creepy right? Anyways, I think this didn't even happen. Something with a picture of her did happen though.. The cover of the book is blue.

I saw for myself how the battalion opened a hail of fire on a group that was descending towards our column. And they were our soldiers, a detachment from the reconnaissance company who had been guarding us on our flank. They were only 200 metres away and we were 90 per cent sure they were our people.

ETA: Another link: http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/04/amazon-acquires-uk-based-online-book-retailer-t... And so you needn't click it, the article: Amazon is acquiring one of its competitors today, announcing that the e-commerce giant has bought The Book Depository International. The Book Depository is a UK-based online bookseller offering over six million books for delivery worldwide. Financial terms of the deal are not disclosed. So why buy this company? The Book Depository, is one of the fastest growing booksellers in Europe. The retailer has over a million customers and also comes with a Dodo Press imprint and a fulfillment centre in Gloucester, UK. The company ships its books free of charge, worldwide, to over 100 countries. Amazon currently offers international sites in Germany, Japan, Austria, Canada, China, France, the UK and also has a Spanish-site for Spanish-speaking countries. But the company no doubt wants to expand beyond these countries and The Book Depository expands its reach with an established customer base in Europe and a fulfillment center. Its unclear from the release if The Book Depository will become an Amazon-owned but independent site or if will be folded into the Amazon platform. I wouldnt be surprised if we see Amazon making similar moves in other countries. We know that the company is looking to expand to India, and an acquisition of Flipkart, the current Amazon of India, would make sense. ",no

Plasma TV falls on her. She wakes up in the body of a teen model. The concept is interesting. I've been following this type of science fiction for a long time, with Heinlein's book about an old man who has a procedure to make himself young and finds himself in the body of a young woman, to Jack Chalker's book with a similar body switch type of situation, to John Varley's Press Enter, and finally to a vaguely remembered story of a man who visits a planet in the body of a slave girl. Actually all of those involve gender switching, while here it is just body switching. The main character started off a tomboy, disliking fashion, makeup, liking video games and unclear if her male best friend remembers that she is female, but she still goes from a female body to a female body. Just goes from plain Jane to supermodel teenager. She goes from smiling and having people flinch, to smiling and having people drool. I read the book in a quick burst. Maybe too quick. I kept waiting for ... something. Not sure what. Then the book ended. Solid book. The people famous for being famous actually turned out to be more interesting than I would have expected. 4 out of 5 stars 2) Beauty and Beast by Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont Started and Finished: July 5 2011 Fiction, Fairy Tale A quick read. The point seemed to be that good things happen to kind hard working young women especially if they seek out ugly dull men (or, at least, men not overcome with their own beauty and wit) with kind hearts, good temperments and being a little overdramatic about the actions of others. Threatening to kill, no, promising to kill a man for taking a rose, unless that man gave up a daughter to die in his place. Later starving himself because the woman he kind of likes is late returning by three days. Written in another era, Beast would be seen as an overly dramatic overly emotional bully. Emo. Beauty being overly selfless, intelligent, hard working young woman. A match made in heaven, I'm sure. 3.5 out of 5 stars ---- And started but not finished (since I only gave it about a ten minute read so far): July 7 2011: Being Nikki --- Now off to check out those TOLI challenge threads.

My most excellent year by Steve Kluger - I have actually read this three times... LOVED IT! The last days of summer by Steve Kluger - a bit harder to get into, and pretty similar to My most excellent year, but I ended up loving this one too.  The uncommon reader by Alan Benett A book I got as a gift, and read in one go- soo funny! Prep by Curtis Sittenfeld. Hm. Hm. Several years ago I had been looking at this in a bookshop and somehow I never bought it, this time I could not resist. I think that I was most annoyed at the main character and did not really understand her. Good writing, for sure...but I dont think that I will read this again.  The skipped parts by Tim Sandlin a tip by the owner in the English bookshop in Uppsala, with whom I had a great chat about books. I am so surprised that this book was allowed to come out, and in the States at that! Funny and sad and a very different book than I have read. I will be buying the sequel too. When I am allowed to buy books again...  Last night at Chateau Marmont Lauren Weisberger Everyone worth knowing Lauren Weisberger Stressed at work and needed something easy, this was my bus read- I had read it before, and liked it much more than The devil wears Prada stupidly this set me to buy the two newer books.. that mainly just annoyed me, but I felt I had to go through them... again, on planes and buses... really I have no other excuse.  Chasing Harry Winstonby Lauren Weisberger My least favourite of her books... the only thing is that it is an easy read.  Cold Comfort Farm by Stella Gibbons I could not resist the deluxe version, ended up giving it to my sister and searched in five shops in London before finding same version. To twice the price. But the cover is priceless. (and aimless, pointless and :). I had liked the film, and of course, the book is even better. Very very funny.  Henrietta sees it through- More news from the homefront 1942-45 Joyce Dennis I love English books from this period, and this is a gem. Very witty and full of English humour, but at the same time, or so I think, giving a good insight how life was in Engliand during WWII.  The weed that strings the hangmans bag by Alan Bredley Back to classics murder mystery. Not surprisingly, from England.  One day by David Nicholls I got this book as gift, and am just happy I read it before the film. I think that many people recognise the situation, not necessarily the characters. The sort of what-if that I play with every now and again.  Come to think of it, I must have read so much more I just cannot remember it.. Anyways, the latest additions: The history of love by Nicole Krauss This is just right up my alley. Well written, and a captivating story with great characters.  In Tearing Haste: Letters Between Deborah Devonshire and Patrick Leigh Fermor by Deborah Devonshire and Patrick Leigh Fermor Correspondance between the youngest Mitford sister and the war hero and author PLF. I thought that it was fascinating, wonder how much was edited away though.. I sat with internet and looked up a lot of people, obituaries, pictures etc.. so different lifes than anything I know, and even though I am sure it has been cleaned up.. but there will be a lot of the Mitfords in my list from now on.  Just like heaven by Julia Quinn She is another one of my guilty secrets.. but I love her books. It is a funny easy read with likeable characters and oh I dont know. Read it in one evening.  Maisie Dobbs by Jacqueline Winspear Not so classic classic mystery novel, England between the wars. I am undecided, have one more in the series and will see what I think..",no

120743,"Hello again - The objectives of my LEC collection is to have every volume in my collection in Fine to Mint condition and to have like slipcases or solander boxes. Slowly but surely I am achieving these goals. Let's talk about the slipcases and solanders first. There is nothing worse than seeing a Fine or better LEC on a shelf encased in a ratty-looking slipcase. In making durable slipcases or solanders is one place where George Macy failed. The original LEC slipcases were probably not made from acid-free boards or paper coverings. However, most of the books were printed on acid-free paper. Macy achieved this by printing on paper which had a 100% rag content. The later Shiff editions upgraded the slipcases or solanders by covering them in cloth with a velour inside covering. This is what I decided to do with all of my older LECs. Some of the horrible LEC slipcases include the foil covered Book of Job and Ruth. I have never seen one of these that lasted. The copper foil-covered Moll Flanders slipcase started peeling while still in the shipping box. Solanders or clamshell boxes were not designed well and were not adequate for the job. You can peruse the many websites which off new solanders and you will see how the cases and boxes of today are so much better than those offerred by the Club. Those made by the LEC were of too thin of board and often the paper coverings would peel or split. The chemise is that wrap-around covering which was placed over the book before inserting it in a slipcase. The chemise is often called by some other name, and I have even heard it called a solander. It was used to offer further protection to the book. All in all it was a bad idea. Most, if they still exist, are falling apart since the chemise must be scored twice to make the wrap-around product. In all truthfullness, the LEC did not have adequate slipcases or solanders until the Shiff era. Next, I will relate how I solved the slipcase problem. It is expensive to replace cases and boxes, but new ones constructed properly can enhance your collection. Like many, I am not in love with the Shiff era titles, but Mr Shiff did solve the slipcase and solander problem.",no

121700,"I usually keep all my LEC Monthly Letters tipped inside the applicable LEC. But I've had a stack of Monthly letters sitting around on a libraryshelf for a few months. So I decided to go through them to see how many were too large to fit inside the appropriate LEC and how many could be fitted into a book. The first one I picked up had some news about the Heritage Press. The Monthly Letter was dated September, 1935. I had not read it when issued since I was only three months old at the time and was not as yet an LEC subscriber. In the Letter, Macy acknowledges that he sent out a letter the preceding July anouncing that the first six HPs would be offered to the members of the LEC. That there would be 1500 copies of these first six books with a special frontispiece signed by the illustrator. That the offering to LEC members would be at bookstore prices (whatever that means). He further says that the books would be issued in two months of the year 1935, November and December. He goes on to say, that as an after thought, he felt that issuing the HPs in the first two months of the eighth series might put a financial strain on members snice they would be paying for an LEC and threes HPs in the months of November and December, 1935. Next, he said that a letter had been sent to all LEC members stating that because of the HP books premeir, the eighth LEC series would be delayed until January of 1936 to give LEC members time to pay for their HPs. Don't give up reading! There's more! Macy says that a ton of letters followed from LECs members protesting the delay of the eighth series because of the HP premeir copies. The members wanted no delay caused by the premeir of the upstart Heritage Press books. Macy relented and didn't delay the eight series of the LEC series and stated that anyone wishing to cancel their order of the HP premeir copies could do so and get a full refund. It would be interesting if anyone in this forum has a copy of these premeir editions. As far as I know, these were the only signed HPs ever printed.

121859,"This is where I'll jump into the Salon's threads and join the rest of you. The one work I'll place alongside those long lists of the rest of you is . . . The Collected Works of Harold Clurman: Six Decades of Commentary on Theatre, Dance, Music, Film, Arts and Letters, all 1102 pages of it (counting its index). It is enough to get us into the arts mentioned above and bring us back home again. Think of it as a first-class, round-trip ticket to a country's history of and involvement in its ""culture"" and that of the world. First off, though, permit me to introduce this man to any who might be unaware of him. (And please forgive my doing this by using words already written about his work in one of my own.) ""This book cannot be praised enough. Like the man from whom it came, it is too big, too magnificent, too extraordinary, too passionate, and too full of life to summarize. There is no way to do either it or him justice. The great English critic Kenneth Tynan came close: 'Few modern critics have traveled so far in search of theatre. Clurman gets to the heart of the matter more rapidly and more cogently than any other critic of his time. I don't think he's ever failed to recognize a new talent. You read Clurman to have your vision of the theatre replenished. If you're losing faith, you go and read Harold.' But even that is much too thin and far too faint to do him justice. Clurman's place as one of the giants, not only in American theater but in the history of the theater in the world, is unquestioned. If most theater critics could meet even three of Clurman's twelve ""The Complete Critic's Qualifications,"" they would be twice the critics they are. I defy anyone to read a single page of this huge work (1055 pages), and not walk away from it with some fresh and significant discovery about the art and literature of our culture, the history of our country, or life in general. In reviewing this book, one critic said were he stranded on a desert isle in some ocean, and informed that the ship to rescue him had finally arrived, he would say 'But First, I have to finish reading this book.' Get your hands on the book in some store or library, take a good look at it, and you will see for yourself."" The book isn't about him, of course, but about all the grand classic arts presented in its title. Harold Clurman was born in 1901 and died in 1980. His offhand remarks and stories read like the Who's Who of American theater, to be sure, but his long life also reads like the What's What of American arts and literature. (There is no such book as the second, of course, but if there were, Clurman would likely have been the only one whose wealth of knowledge, first-hand involvement, demonstrated professional expertise, and widely acclaimed ability to write was broad enough, deep enough -- and yes, high and grand enough -- to find the right and truly telling words to ever fill its pages.) Imagine, eighteen and in school at Columbia in New York, he skipped his classes one February afternoon to take in the first performance of a play just opening at the Morosco Theatre by a largely unknown thirty-one year old playwright. The play, Beyond The Horizon, by Eugene O'Neill. The point is, Clurman was there; as he also was when his father scraped together enough to send him to Paris to study at the Sorbonne from 1921-1924, where another student friend was on the way to becoming one of the favorite musical celebrities: Aaron Copland. Harold was there too, as he would be in numerous other places over the next sixty years at one incredible history-making event after another. With his eyes open, his passion aflame, his mind alert, and his pen always at hand. And he used it royally, and the 2,000 results of that are contained in this book, with a good many scattered elsewhere. But let us bring this to a close by sharpening the focus and turning the spotlight on this man full force, listening to what another monumental figure, later to become a famous director of both stage and film, had to say about him. ""He was the best first-week director of our time, as he was our best theater critic. What he did during that marvelous first week's work was to illuminate the play's theme, then sketch each role brilliantly, defining its place in building the final meaning of the production. . . .He had a unique way of talking to actors -- I didn't have it and I never heard of another director who did; he turned them on with his intellect, his analyses, and his insights. But also by his high spirits. Harold's work was joyous. He didn't hector his actors from an authoritarian position; he was a partner, not an overlord, in the struggle of production. He'd reveal to each actor at the onset a concept of his or her performance, one the actor could not have anticipated and could not have found on his own. Harold's visions were brilliant; actors were eager to realize them. His character descriptions were full of details, of stage ""business."" They were also full of compassion for the characters' dilemmas, their failings and their aspirations. . . .I used to read the notes he made in the margin of his text and to write down what he said to the actors after each rehearsal."" (These are the words of Elia Kazan, taken from his autobiography,  A Life.) That's an indication of the richness to be found in the work and writings of Harold Clurman. And the marvel of the material is this: it is written with so much obvious underlying humanity, that even the untrained person can grasp the greater part of everything it says. That is an essential aspect of the wide-ranging greatness of this gifted man. * * * A simple way to indicate your views on this huge topic:  1) identify individuals who stand out in your own experience;  2) place their name in the field in which they work  letters and names short-list A  (for Actor) Dr  (for Director/Choreographer) W  (for Writer) Dn  (for Dancer) M  (for Composer/Lyricist/Musician) S  (for title of Show, Film, or Performance) T  (Theater) (A mish mash of samples in no particular order:) A- Sarah Bernhardt, Charlie Chaplin, Edwin Booth, Marlene Dietrich, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, Eleanora Duse, Michael Redgrave, Edith Piaf, Stanley Holloway, Buster Keaton, Simon Callow, Yul Brynner, Maria Callas, Marcel Marceau, Denzel Washington, Laurel & Hardy, Patti Lupone, Hermione Gingold, James Earl Jones, the Marx brothers, Laurence Olivier, Ethel Waters, Abbott & Costello, Kevin Kline, Ralph Richardson, William Warfield, Ettore Bastianini, Ingrid Berman, Orson Welles  Dr- D.W.

122339,"I know many of my questions/requests have been similar, but females' roles in science fiction and fantasy do interest me, not from some political feminist agenda but from the standpoint of personal enjoyment -- I like to read stories in which female characters do cool things. So I'm interested in a number of aspects, not the least of which is the one (at least from my perception) most difficult to find: the female nonhuman, the female ""Other,"" depicted in a sympathetic light. Sympathetically drawn male ""Other"" characters are plentiful. They have their basis in folklore, with the Beauty-and-the-Beast trope, but lately the surge of heroic male vampires, werewolves, angels, demons, elves, shape-shifting dragons, etc. seems driven by the popularity of a certain book series which I hate far more than I ought to hate a book series I flat out refuse to read. Nonhuman males are heroes, lovers, saviors. But nonhuman females? Rare -- and, more often than not, evil. I can think of very few examples of nonhuman female protagonists. There's Firelight, which unfortunately looks like yet another ""Twilight"" knockoff even if the female does get to be the Other this time. There are Patricia Briggs' Alpha and Omega books, which may be quite good (I like this author). There are Kelley Armstrong's books about Elena the female werewolf in her Women of the Otherworld series. Nonhuman females appear a little more frequently in significant supporting roles, like the magnificent Safira in Christopher Paolini's Eragon. Safira may be a marvelous creature, but unfortunately Paolini's not that much of a writer.  Even with these exceptions, good and bad and mediocre, female Other characters still seem highly outnumbered by male, especially when it comes to sympathetic depictions. (The female Other cast in an evil light is not hard to find at all.) So I'm interested in learning more about good fantasy and sci-fi books which feature a nonhuman female -- werewolf, vampire, angel, demon, dragon, alien, etc. -- in a significant and sympathetic role, either as protagonist or important supporting character.  What are some of the best/favorite books of this kind? ",yes
122387,"This thread is continued from http://www.librarything.com/topic/115453 146. Saint's Gate by Carla Neggers - Agent Emma Sharpe has been called back to the convent where she was once a novice by Sister Joan to comment on a painting. Emma's family had been involved in art restoration for years and now Emma investigates art crimes for the FBI. Sister Joan goes to the tower where the painting is located, surprising a thief. When Sister Joan doesn't return as expected, Emma sets off to find her. She encounters a novice named Cecelia along the way. She finds Sister Joan dead, it becomes a matter for local law enforcement, but naturally, she gets involved. Another FBI agent, Colin Donovan is in the area. Her boss Matt Yankowski comes up from Boston. Colin's friend Father Finian Bracken also plays an important role. All the crimes seem to be related to a period shortly after Sister Linden made the convent known for its art. I found this an enjoyable read. I liked the Maine setting. I enjoyed the characters. The plot was different from a lot of mysteries. While there is a touch of romance, I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a romantic suspense because the lead female character is law enforcement official instead of a governess, secretary, or other household servant.

It was set in Scotland and was probably based on the legend that Glamis castle in Scotland has a secret chamber that holds a terrible secret known only to the British royal family. In the story there is a room in a castle holding a secret that turns out to be an imprisoned man who was granted the 'gift' of immortality - only to find, of course, that although he cannot die, he simply keeps ageing forever. I remember it being quite creepy. There was a verse recited by someone, maybe the villagers, that went ""(Name - more about this is a minute) will nae die; (name) can nae die"". The title of the story was the old man's name which may have been Robbie Lawry; I'm fairly sure about the Lawry bit but less sure about his first name. Many thanks for any help.

12262,"Ok, so I just found out about and bought a copy of what has got to be one of the most amasing genre-blending works I've ever seen, the Invention of Hugo Cabret. The book is about a 12 year homeless boy living in a train station in the '20's, who is trying to unlock the mystery of an automata he found near where his father died. What makes this interesting is it blends aspects of a traditional novel with movies, picture books, and comics. A full 284 pages of the ~400 page book are highly detailed pencil drawings that aren't illustrations but are actually used to progress the plot. What I still can't seem to decide is whether it qualifies as YA or is a children's book. Certainly many of the aspects qualify it as a YA title, the preteen character, the semi-dark nature of the plot, the niche film history blended into the narrative (one of the primary characters is meant to be Melies, a famous French director from the era of silent films) and his works play a key role in the plot.

I once heard a speaker address the question, ""What's the difference between YA and adult fantasy?"" and then give a simple one-word answer -- ""Hope."" It's this hope, this acknowledgement that human/alien/Other nature may have a bright side as well as a dark side, that makes a refreshing change. (I'm plowing through ""A Song of Fire and Ice"" as we speak, and while I'm relishing it, I'd also welcome a counterbalance to its despair.) However, I've also discovered that, aside from Harry Potter, I don't really care much for fantasy set in contemporary times, particularly ""urban fantasy."" I prefer a period (WW II or previous) or a mythical setting. I'd like to see my YA heroes and heroines fighting magical battles, but I'm not so keen on seeing them forced to navigate the mean corridors of the modern high school. It's a milieu in which I'd rather not spend much time. Yet I've noticed that among the new YA releases, nine out of ten are contemporary or ""urban"" fantasy. So maybe you guys know some good titles that don't follow that tide. Here's what I'm looking for: 1) Again, a setting other than contemporary. Futuristic is okay but not preferred. Steampunk is definitely acceptable. But mythic is preferred above all else. 2) Both male and female characters given importance in the story, treated with sympathy, and given the chance to act heroically. I'm not interested in books that bash the guys, just as I'm not interested in books that sideline the gals.  3) Romance is okay but not essential. I prefer love stories when they are a part, but not the whole, of the protagonist's journey.",yes

In one place in Post Captain, the substitute is followed later on the same page with an explicit ""fucking""! And he's also used ""whore"", ""bugger"", and I think ""sodding"" in other instances, often in the mouth of Jack. So the questions: Is O'Brian nodding to period authenticity in these substitutes? If so, are the substitutes standing-in always for the same obscenity, or different ones? Which obscenities were more offensive than the F-word in the days of Aubrey & Maturin? Is O'Brian playing around with the reader, presuming each individual can imagine a more offensive term than he could choose, and that's the effect he's after? So, in fact, there is not a specific obscenity in mind, in these instances. Is O'Brian willing to spell out certain words but not others (though that last example seems to bely that, since the F-word surely would be a prime offender)?

124390,"I've just finished my first Australian book in ages and want to try to do this challenge in the next year or so. Of course, now that I've said that I'm guaranteed to read anything but Australian books - it's happened several times already in other groups. My first book was for NSW and it was Kate Grenville's latest, Sarah Thornhill. I gave it 3 1/2 stars, and have copied my comments from my 75 Books Challenge thread below. This is the sequel to Kate Grenville's excellent The Secret River, but I don't think it matters if you read this one first. I had totally forgotten what happened in The Secret River, which is pretty dopy because at the time I loved it and immediately added Kate Grenville to my favourite authors list on here. Not remembering did not detract from the book at all, and if anything made it slightly better because there was clearly a Dark Secret From The Past. Sarah Thornhill is the youngest of 5 children in the Thornhill family. Her father, William, and her mother Meg were English convicts who were sent to Australia. William is now well-off, remarried to a very unlikable woman, and doing a pretty good job at being upright and respectable. Sarah talks about the ""taint"" of being an ex-convict though, which is still there. Grenville does a great job again at making you feel like you are back in Australia 200 years ago, up the Hawkesbury River. Sarah grows up and falls in love with Jack Langland, from one of the other farming families in their community. Jack's mother was an Aborigine woman but he's been brought up in the Langland family as one of them, but only up to a point. Jack's best friend is Will, Sarah's oldest brother, and they work on the sealing boats that go to New Zealand. There's a strong New Zealand strand to the story (but I don't want to give away the plot). As you'd expect in a book set in early Australia the main themes are race and class and the different attitudes of the immigrants to the Aborigines. Mostly though this reads like a straightforward good story of Sarah and how she falls in love with a boy who's not good enough for her parents. I really enjoyed it, but it didn't blow me away like the Secret River did at the time.",no

He goes on to point out the lack of physical evidence for consciousness . "" ... The problem, however, is that no evidence for consciousness exists in the physical world. 6 Physical events are simply mute as to whether it is like something to be what they are. The only thing in this universe that attests to the existence of consciousness is consciousness itself; the only clue to subjectivity, as such, is subjectivity. Absolutely nothing about a brain, when surveyed as a physical system, suggests that it is a locus of experience. Were we not already brimming with consciousness ourselves, we would find no evidence of it in the physical universenor would we have any notion of the many experiential states that it gives rise to. The painfulness of pain, for instance, puts in an appearance only in consciousness. And no description of C-fibers or pain-avoiding behavior will bring the subjective reality into view. ... "" Theists keep insisting that there is such a thing as a disembodied personality, even though there is no physical evidence for it.  Atheists (this atheist, anyway) consider that, sorry to be so blunt, daft; and yet, couldn't theists turn around and say that my belief in consciousness is equally as well (or ill) founded (in subjective experience and nothing more) as their belief in spirits?  Hmmm....there is a lack of symmetry on this point: That atheists and theists both ""believe"" in consciousness, i.e. both agree that if things seem any way at all, that's consciousness, and that yes, things seem like ""something"" to us all. But only theists discover spirits in their subjective experience,  whatever that may mean in the end.  Nevertheless. the lack of physical evidence for consciousness is a troublesome point for us empiricist, naturalist, materialist ""realist"" whatevers.  ",no

127208,"The real continuation of the old thread is here http://www.librarything.com/topic/127225 =========================== _____________________ =========================== This thread is a reply to this particular post. http://www.librarything.com/topic/126234#3047181 You are getting there, but not quite there yet. (For example, no probability can be greater than 1.) But OK, I'll play with burglars and chupacabras for a while. Let's define some terms. There are three events we are interested in. A = ""my alarm is set off"" B = ""there are burglars in the neighborhood"" C = ""there are chupacabras in the neighborhood"" Now the burglars are really just a red herring for our purposes, they just serve to make the problem more complicated, but I'll keep them in for now. I find that when things are a little complicated, it sometimes helps to draw a picture, so here is a diagram that represents the probability space. Media:Rings.png|Probability Space http://www.librarything.com/wiki/index.php?title=Image:Rings.png The black circle encloses the whole space and has an area of one. The the red circle represents the case that my alarm is set off. Its area is proportional to the probability that my alarm is set off.  The the green circle represents the case that there are burglars in the neighborhood. Its area is proportional to the probability that there are burglars in the neighborhood.  The the blue circle represents the case that there are chupacabras in the neighborhood. Its area is proportional to the probability that there are chupacabras in the neighborhood.  The letters represent 8 distinct cases where the circles overlap. S is the case not A and not B and not C. T is the case A and not B and not C. U is the case A and B and not C. V is the case A and not B and C. W is the case A and B and C. X is the case not A and B and C. Y is the case not A and B and not C. Z is the case not A and not B and C. Note that each of the areas at the intersection of the circles represents a probability whose area is proportional to its area. Each has an area less than one. Let's first consider the case where my alarm has not been set off. What is the probability that there are chupacabras in the neighborhood? Well that is just the sum of the areas in the blue circle. P(C) = V+W+X+Z And the probability that there are no chupacabras in the neighborhood is the sum of the areas outside of the blue circle. P(~C) = S+T+U+Y We are sitting in my kitchen chatting about chupacabras and burglars. I am adamant that there are no chupacabras in the neighborhood, I guess that P(C) = 0.01. You are almost certain there are and guess that P(C) = 0.99. In fact you are willing to bet me that there are, offering me odds of 99:1. Now the true odds that there are chupacabras in the neighborhood is O(C) = P(C)/P(~C) It is clear that if we disagree about the probability that there are chupacabras in the neighborhood, we disagree about the size of the blue circle. But I take your bet. Now, as we are sitting in my kitchen, my alarm goes off. You realize that the fact that the alarm went off changes the odds that there are chupacabras in the neighborhood. The whole probability space has now shrunk to just the areas inside the red circle. We need to recalculate the probabilities and the odds. We agree that if either the probability or the odds go up, then the fact that the alarm went off should be taken as evidence that there are chupacabras in the neighborhood. So what are the probabilities and the odds? Now we are only restricted to the red circle, so P( C given A ) = (V+W) / (T+U+V+W)  that is the proportion of the red circle which is also part of the blue circle. Note that this will always be less than or equal to one. We also need P(~C given A ) = T+U / (T+U+V+W)  and the new odds are O( C given A ) = (V+W) / (T+U) Or if we use the formula of the Good Reverent. P( C given A ) = P( A given C ) P ( C) / P(A) P(~C given A ) = P( A given ~C ) P (~C) / P(A) where  P(A) = T+U+V+W P(C) = V+W+X+Z P(~C) = S+T+U+Y and the likelihoods P( A given C ) = P( A and C ) / P( C) = (V+W) / (V+W+X+Z) P( A given ~C ) = P( A and ~C ) / P(~C) = (T+U) / (S+T+U+Y) Note all of these are less than one. The formula for the new odds is O( C given A ) = P( C given A ) / P( ~C given A )   = P( A given C ) / P( A given ~C ) * P ( C) / P (~C)  = (V+W) / (T+U) The simplest formula we can use to verify whether A is evidence for C is the odds ratio OR( C given A) = O( C given A ) / O( C ) = P( A given C ) / P( A given ~C ) Note, to derive this formula we haven't made any explicit reference to the burglars.  Now, if you think that OR( C given A) is greater than one, you can say that A is evidence for C and if OR( C given A) is less than one you can say that A is evidence for ~C. So it all comes down to how you assess the relative size of P( A given C ) and P( A given ~C ), that is how you would assess the likelihood of the alarm being set off given that there are chupacabras in the neighborhood against the likelihood of the alarm being set off given that there are no chupacabras in the neighborhood. Now, if you insist on bringing burglars into the mix, I suppose we could ask a different question along the lines of does the event A lend more support to B than C, and this may be where you were trying to go. For that the Bayes Factor comparing two hypotheses would be the way to go. The relative probability of B and C is R( B,C ) = P(B)/P(C) and the Bayes Factor is the amount by which R changes given the evidence BF(B,C given A) = R(B,C given A)/R(B,C) = P(B given A)/P(C given A)) / (P(B)/P(A))   = P(A given B)/P(A given C) So to evaluate that we need the additional likelihood P(A given B), that is the likelihood of the alarm being set off given burglars in the neighborhood.  So, to conclude, to answer the question ""Is A evidence for C"" we need to estimate two likelihoods P(A given C) and P(A given ~C). To answer the question ""Does A lend more support to B than C"" we need to estimate the two likelihoods P(A given B) and P(A given C). Those are the only three numbers we need. The real question is can we estimated them consistently and reliably and if we disagree, how can we resolve that disagreement? Maybe we should make a bet. Just to add the touchstones to the books from the other thread. Some of the applications of Bayes Theorem to questions of the existence of God. The most well known is The Existence of God by Richard Swinburne.

She does poorly in the game, because of the disease. I'm pretty sure the disease starts with an A. Then, as she leaves the gym, in a huff, she tries to open her car door with her keys but is having trouble because of the blind spot. Her friend can see that, I don't remember what he does about it though. They end up going somewhere where they hang out at a beach, and she can't see his face very well. He ends up telling her he loves her, but I think she reacts badly. Because she feels it is out of pity. She runs away to a place where it snows, I think. The guy finds out by looking in a drawer and finding a brochure. They find her but she had been lost in the snow, I think. This part might not have happened at all. Every once in a while it flashes to her while she is thinking in her mind, laying there in a coma. She thinks of her husband (the friend she had) and her daughter? I think. So yea, she learns how to walk with those white cane things, and might even have a dog? But it ends with her waking up and seeing her husband. It ends up being that either, her husband died from the crash and she grew old without him, or she's in a coma because of the crash, while her husband had already died from it. Either way, her husband is there beside her, his spirit I guess, and he asks her if she's ready or something.. I don't know if that's how it goes but please, if anyone knows this book I'd really appreciate it if someone would let me know. I need to know soon, I was hoping to do a project on the disease the woman had.",yes

127927,"I've found one of the best ways to keep up with the field of SF is to follow the various ""Best of the Year"" anthology series. In the beginning - starting with a 1949 hardcover, Best Science Fiction Stories: 1949 - Bleiler and Dikty did an annual series (which was then carried on JUST by Dikty): http://www.librarything.com/series/The+Best+Science+Fiction+Stories This ran from 1949-1957. (They also did three volumes of ""Year's Best Science Fiction Novels"" from 1952-54.)   It was 'succeeded' by Judy Merril's series, which ran under various titles from 1956-1967: http://www.librarything.com/series/The+Year%27s+Best+S-F , 'Succeeded' by Wolheim and Carr for Ace Books from 1965-71: http://www.librarything.com/series/World%27s+Best+Science+Fiction Harry Harrison and Brian Aldiss did a series from 1967 to 1975: http://www.librarything.com/series/The+Year%27s+Best+SF (So, for most years since the mid-60s, there have been multiple ""Best SF of the Year"" anthologies to choose from.) In 1972, Wollheim took the ""annual anthology"" with him to his own DAW Books: so in the early '70s, the succession to the ""Ace / Wollheim&Carr"" series gets ambiguous for a couple years: Ace carried on with new editors - Fred Pohl edited a competing volume for 1972 ( http://www.librarything.com/work/1537418 ), Ackerman did the volume for 1973: http://www.librarything.com/work/707912 ...), while  Wolheim continued the series with DAW (with co-editor Saha) from 1972 until 1990; (and here, LT views the ""DAW/Wollheim"" series as a continuation of the ""Ace/Wollheim&Carr"" series);   while Terry Carr went off to edit a rival series for Ballantine, from 1972-1986: http://www.librarything.com/series/The+Year%27s+Best+Science+Fiction+%2526+Fanta... . (Carr also did a short-lived (two years) ""Best SF Novellas"" anthology series for Ballantine.)  Also in the '70s, Lester del Rey edited a series (carried on by Dozois) in hardcover for Dutton, ten volumes 1972-81: http://www.librarything.com/series/Dutton+Best+Science+Fiction+Stories+of+the+Ye... Mike Ashley compiled ""the best of 1975"", but it only saw print as SF Choice 77 for Quartet, and turned out to be a one-shot. DAW published two volumes of ""Terra SF: the Best European SF of the Year"", in 1981 and 1983. Across the Atlantic, there was short-lived ""Orbit SF Yearbook"" series for three years in the late '80s: http://www.librarything.com/series/Orbit+Science+Fiction+Yearbook; In 1985 there was a one-shot Science Fiction Yearbook, edited by Pournelle; And then the longest run, Gardner Dozois' ""The Year's Best Science Fiction"" series, from 1984 to date: http://www.librarything.com/series/Dozois+Year%27s+Best+Science+Fiction. (The Dozois series has run long enough that there are now two ""meta"" anthologies of ""best stories"" drawn from his ""Best of the Year"" series. Presumably for people interested only in the best of the best....) Hartwell and Cramer (1996-to-date), now in its 16th annual volume: http://www.librarything.com/series/Year%27s+Best+SF Strahan tried a short lived Year's Best Australian Science Fiction and Fantasy that lasted two years, 1997-8. Early in the 21st century, a short-lived series edited by Robert Silverberg: http://www.librarything.com/series/Science+Fiction%3A+The+Best+of... Strahan - http://www.librarything.com/series/Best+Science+Fiction+and+Fantasy+of+the+Year, now in its fifth year; a prior ""2005"" volume for Locus; and his short-lived ""best novels"" series http://www.librarything.com/series/Best+short+novels from 2004-7 A one-off Best Science Fiction & Fantasy for Teens for 2005; Congreve tried again with a Year's Best Australian Science Fiction and Fantasy series; this time out it ran 2005-9 Rich Horton - Best SF from 2006-8: http://www.librarything.com/series/Science+Fiction%3A+The+Best+of+the+Year ..., and which is now succeeded by his ""Best SF & F"" http://www.librarything.com/series/The+Year%27s+Best+Science+Fiction+%2526+Fanta... (2009-2011) (In addition to the hundreds of ""Year's Best SF"" anthologies, there's also a closely-related annual anthology from SFWA, collecting the Nebula winners for most years from 1965 to date; this is more-or-less a ""best of the year"" series, one selected by the trade association of the science fiction writers of America, and with a changing editor-of-record. 45 volumes since 1965; but not quite continuously, as they managed to miss a couple/three years in the 1990s: http://www.librarything.com/series/Nebula+Award+Stories )  (There are also various ""Year's Best FANTASY"" anthology series - most notably, 21 annual volumes of the recently-demised ""Datlow and Windling"" series; and further afield, various ""Year's Best Horror"" series.)  Also related: Asimov edited a retrospective series of ""The Great SF Stories"" going back to 1939: so, a run of 25 ""annual"" volumes from 1939 to 1963. (Silverberg edited the final volume of these ""retrospective best of the year"" anthologies, to cover 1964 and to explicitly tie in to the 1965 start of the Ace/Wollheim/Carr series: http://www.librarything.com/work/2852072/book/4050459 .) Limiting the count to JUST SF, then, all told, over the last 62 years there have been well over 140 volumes purporting to bring us the ""Best SF of the Year"" - an average of over two per year. (Anybody feel like counting them all up?) (And - for extra credit - what year saw the greatest choice of available ""Best of the Year"" anthologies? Currently, we have four to choose from: Dozois, Hartwell/Cramer, Strahan, and Horton.)  I'll be glad to edit this to flesh it out; my hope is to assemble this information in one place, for the benefit of collectors. ",no

A few months ago the author gave a presentation on C-Span2's BookTV. http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Area51 I found the following to be particularly unnerving: ""...the Atomic Energey Commission could hire a private company to conduct research for the commission knowing that the company's thinking and research would be born classified and that even the president of the United States would not necessarily have a need-to-know about it. In 1994, for example, when President Clinton created by executive order the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments to look into the secrets kept by the Atomic Energy Commission, certain records involving certain programs inside and around Area 51 were kept from the president on the grounds that he did not have a need-to-know.""

I joined LT a few years ago and completed challenges in 09 and 10 but during 11 I sort of fell into a slump and although I continued to list the books I read I didn't post any reviews or contribute to posts. For 2012 I am determined to be a contributing member for the full year and to stop the quiet lurking on threads. Not sure if I will manage 12 books in each of the categories as my reading has slowed significantly this year with work and family.  Categories to follow: 1. Young Adult - you are never to old to read these 2. Kiwi - I have been trying for a few years to read more from my own country 3. Waltzing Matilda - neighbours across the ditch 4. Hot off the press - new releases 5. Must reads - recommendations from others 6. Who dunnit - mystery/thrillers 7. Continuing sagas - series 8. Off the shelf - books I own but haven't opened 9. Real life - biographies/nonfiction 10. Ageless tomes - classics I haven't read 11. Girly fun - chicklit 12. Catch all - category to catch all remaining books 1. January total - 19 books read 2.

129308," Best Holiday Wishes from my house to yours!! From the introductions page... Hi all, I'm Marilyn, 58, living in southern New Hampshire with two sons, 19 & 17 years old, and two cats, 9 years old. This will be my fifth year on LT. Love the 75ers as a group, though I haven't yet made it through that many books in a year. That is partially due to poor record-keeping and inconsistent posting on my part, though, so this year my watchword is ""consistency""! I read mostly nonfiction - ranging from science and nature to memoirs and history, with a fair amount of education, neuroscience and technology thrown in for good measure. I dabble a bit in genealogy and local history and live in a very old house, so there's a bit of preservation as well. I work in the library at an independent boarding school (grades 9-12), so I also fit in a bit of YA here and there. I enjoy needlework and am active in an online crafts group at Craftster.org. Gardening is another interest, and a small vineyard figures prominently in my retirement plans! Glad to be back with the 75's and looking forward to lots of new reading ideas this year. As always, I'm hoping to post more regularly than I have done in the past and to be more comprehensive in my listing of titles read...we'll see! I've also joined the NonFiction Challenge group this year, with a thread here Number of books read in 2012....  Number books sent on to others in 2012... Number of books bought in 2012...  Books I've read this year: 13. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs 12. Telling Your Own Stories by Donald Davis 11.

Heirs of Hammerfell by Marion Zimmer Bradley Books I've bought this year: 1. Walden by Henry David Thoreau - to read for class, only $6.98 at B&N! 2. The Elements of Style 4th edition by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White - to read for class, replaces the one I bought in high school in 1968 3. This Boy's Life by Tobias Wolff - to read for class 4.

129317,"It would be great if someone could ID this book that keeps niggling at me. (Don't you hate when that happens?) There were two alien species. One was very aggressive and drafted skilled workers from a more peaceful species onto large spaceships. The ships also had a population of the peaceful species that called themselves ship bred or ship born. The POV is mostly a ship born female. They used implants for inter-species communications. The very aggressive species set aside sections of the ship for raising their own young and were even unpredictable and explosively violent near that area. The female overlord-type running one ship drafted a technician, implanted him, paired him with the POV female of his species. Then she bought a human spacer out of lot of wild humans and added him to the group and ordered the other two to see if they could come to understand him. Along the way, there was a planetary invasion/destruction, because the humans had on it didn't immediately comply the demands of the overlord-types. The POV female discovered she was unable to function under an open sky. The implanted human insisted on rescuing a human child, much to the bafflement of the other two species. There was a rival ship, run by a male overlord-type, that also picked up some humans and wound up putting a mother and her child in the nesting area because they didn't have any children of their own species. The two ships came together and established some sort of alliance/relationship.  The book had a Cherryh feel in that it threw you into alien cultures without much explanation, but it isn't one of hers. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",yes

129400,"Received two more LECs right after Christmas. The first, The Way of the World, a Restoration play by William Congreve, is not hard to find in Fine condition. Illustrated by T. M. Clelland, it has Clelland's usual elaborate spread title pages. From the Decameron onward, Clelland became Macy's illustrative expert in 18th century and further back literature. The ones I can remember without consulting my bibliography are:The Decameron, Tristram Shandy, Jonathon Wilde, and Tom Jones. Congreve's play is bound in full maroon cloth, elaborately blind stamped. Not a tremendously popular book or expensive ($50 for a Fine copy), but well conceived by Clelland. I read somewhere that Cllelland claimed to be a distant relative of John Clelland, author of Fanny Hill, and if it was ever published in a Fine edition he would like to illustrate it. The second LEC I received is the Temptation of St. Anthony by Gustave Flaubert and illustrated by Walter Chappell who was a graphic artist, book designer, and type designer. I don't have the Monthly Letter, but I know he studied under Boardman Robinson, another noted LEC illustrator. This book is rather hard to find in Fine condition so I'm happy to find a copy of this 1943 LEC. The illustrations use strong colors and almost leap out of the page at you. Chappell spent some time in Germany just prior to WWII so perhaps his strong drawings remind me somewhat of German Expressionism. Anyway, the book is a very unusual LEC, and I'm glad I acquired it. Anyone with a Monthly letter for this book can perhaps fill us in on the graphic style of Walter Chappell. ",no

I will be putting in small reviews of each book that I read.  This will also help me to not be a lurker on the LT site. I read a lot of the threads here on GD, but have very seldom posted on any. I have starred many of the other reading journals here, as a way to help me in my own, and to hopefully get to 'know' some of you.

130988,"I've been reading a great deal about ebook prices and how $0.99 is bad, etc. I have, maybe, a slightly different take on all this.   First, I think it should be the author's decision. And quite honestly, I feel that saying we shouldn't do $0.99 books benefits the big publishers more than it does the Independent Author. Why? Because they don't want to compete with lower priced books. If Indie Authors publish at higher prices, then someone making a decision between an unknown and an established author (or someone new from an established publisher), then they are more likely to go with the 'known' factor.  So, this should be the author's choice and it has nothing to do with the quality of the work. Only the material itself can be used to judge if the book is good or bad. Don't make the mistake of using anything but the writing as a way to determine quality. I think too many people want to make decisions without actually having to work at reading something.   However. . . . My personal choice is that price should be an indication of length. My lower priced pieces are shorter works and I would not expect anyone to pay novel-length price for them. I also do not expect to pay $2.99 for short work, fiction or nonfiction. In that respect, I think authors should be honest with their readers about length of works. I am glad to see Amazon has approximate length on many of the items. They are using the standard of about 250 words per page -- a good count for most paperbacks with dialogue. I am not going to spend $5 for 4 pages of words. This is my personal feeling, but when authors overprice their work for the length I feel they're being dishonest. For my The Two Year Novel Course, I purposely put them at $0.99 cents for two important reasons. First, though the nine sets are going to vary in length, none of them will be a full book length.  Second, I want the work to be accessible to people who are looking for help in writing and don't have a lot of income to spare. $0.99 a month (or so) isn't unreasonable. I do it to help, just like the many other things I do to help new writers. Since Amazon and Barnes and Noble will not allow independent authors to put books up for free, this is as inexpensive as I could make them. So, don't judge an offering by the price. Judge by what it is. ",no

131027,"Main tutored reads thread Tutored reads wiki From the discussion on the main tutored reads thread it seems like a general group read of A Tale of Two Cities with one or more additional threads where people can be tutored on the book might be the easiest way for this to work. I am happy to act as a tutor on the tutored read threads but I don't really feel comfortable leading a general group read although I would still follow the group read threads. My thoughts at the moment regarding the tutored read are that we could have a separate tutored read thread for each section that the book - probably easiest to tie this in with however the book is split up for the group read. And whilst there may be a schedule for the group read, there wouldn't be a schedule for the tutored reads threads so that the tutees can read at their own pace. So that I know when I need to be monitoring the tutored read threads, I'll need to know who would like to be tutored. Further suggestions and comments are welcome :-) So, some questions: 1) Do you want to participate in a general group read of A Tale of Two Cities? 2) Would you like to be tutored on A Tale of Two Cities? (I appreciate you might not know until you start reading the book or start following any tutored read threads we set up but it would be helpful to get an idea of numbers now.) 3) What sort of timings would be best for you?

131036,"I completed Deep River last night. Here's my review: __________ I liked this book more and more as I read it. Each of the 5 characters' stories was engaging and poignant in a different way, but it really grabbed me after they arrived in India. Although Endo was a Christian, I didn't find find this story to be predominantly Christian. In fact, it strives to be much more than that-- the story of the journey to salvation and love that is common to several religions (Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism.) I think Endo even makes a point that individual religions trying to own or constrain that journey is what leads to strife, poverty, war.  There are several Christ figures in the story: the myna, Otsu, Indira Gandhi, Isobe's wife, Kiguchi's war buddy, but then there's the Hindu goddess to balance it all out. I think this book would make excellent material for a comparative religion discussion. Even if it is a Christian story, it is definitely an Eastern interpretation.  Endo's writing was interesting to me. Having just completed three other Japanese novels, this book does read differently. It could be because it is more contemporary, but I realized I was not picturing Japanese characters in my mind while reading. Somehow, very subtly, his European affinity and influences come out in his writing. Could be the translation too. I look forward to reading more of his novels so I can compare them. 4.25 stars. ____________ This book is ripe for discussion. There are many layers of subtleties in the themes and characters.  Has anyone else had the same experience reading Endo: that is doesn't feel as Japanese as other novels do? I could not away from picturing Mitsuko as a blonde haired blue eyed Caucasian.",no
131039,"Time for a new thread! In case you missed all this in the first one: I'm Amber, a classicist, wife of a physicist, mom of a 3-year-old Charlie, servant to a Tuppence (a border collie) and a Susie (15-year-old calico cat), percussionist, baker, knitter, seamstress of sorts, and general all-round crafter. I like to post pictures of my latest crafting/knitting/sewing projects (and sometimes my baking adventures too) as well as my reads, so I hope you all don't mind.  Last year was all about Waterhouse paintings. This year, I thought I'd broaden it to other classically-themes paintings and such, mostly stuff I used to show my mythology courses. This time, it's a relief of Athene, my favorite of the Greek gods:  So, welcome all! I'm looking forward to more chatter and reading this year! I feel that I've made so many fantastic friends here, and I love the idea of spending another year reading with you and learning more about you. Below youll find an explanation of my reading habits, which, I warn you, is a bit crazy. Usually I have about 10-12 books going at once, one each from the following groups (and occasionally other books slipped in there too): 1. A library book. I'd tell you how I pick these, but it's too embarrassing. Maybe you'll figure it out as the year unfolds... 2. A book from the 100 Banned Books book (at least currently. As soon as I finish this list, I'll replace it with another, and oh, I've got tons of lists). 3. A children's book, for Charlie's library. I'm trying to collect books from various award lists, and I like reading them before reading them to Charlie or deciding to add them to Charlie's shelves. For this category, Im working through a few different lists: NEH Timeless Classics list Newbery Winners list 1001 Childrens Books You Must Read Before You Die John Bellairs' bibliography The Black Stallion books/Farley bibliography Beverly Cleary's bibliography 4. A book from the Green Dragon 1001 Fantasy List, in chronological order. 5. A book for the Presidential Challenge. Books for this category are read in chronological (presidentially) order. 6. An audio book, which I listen to as I knit/sew/otherwise craft. 7. For this category, I cycle through 9 different stacks: a. A book from my shelves which I haven't yet read b. A CYOA book - I'm trying to collect as many of these as I can, again, for Charlie. c. Agatha Christie's bibliography (in chronological order) d. Stephen King's bibliography (in chronological order) e. Neil Gaiman's bibliography (in some order other than chronological (don't ask)). f. Christopher Moore's bibliography (in chronological order) g. Stephen Fry's bibliography (in chronological order) h. The National Book Award list (in alpha order by title) i. The Pulizer list (in alpha order by author) So, now you've got a glimpse of just how neurotic I am. Please feel free to post comments, recommendations, or whatever else strikes your fancy. And Happy Reading, everyone! What I'm reading now: -John Stuart Mill Autobiography, Essay on Liberty/ Thomas Carlyle Characteristics, Inaugural Address, Essay on Scott (library book) -Ulysses (banned books list) -Ulysses Annotated (because I'm gonna need some help, I think) -Ramona the Pest (Cleary bibliography) -The Faerie Queen (The Green Dragon 1001 Fantasy List) -James Madison (Presidential Challenge) -The Know-It-All (audio book) -Four Past Midnight (King bibliography) -The Children's Hour Volume 7: Favorite Mystery Stories (I'm working through this series of old volumes that were my brothers' when they were little.)

131115,"Last year I didn't come close to 50, here's hoping I'll do a little better this year now that I have discovered the wonder of audiobooks for those long drives to work! Alas, grad school will still take up most of my mental capacity for reading. So far this year: 1. My Indian Kitchen by Hari Nayak  I love Indian food, though sometimes it burns my mouth! Good pictures and good breadth in terms of essential spices and assorted pantry items. Some recipes were a little involved and I'm not sure if I could find all the desired spices. To be fair, I haven't looked either. All-in-all I enjoyed this.  2. The Last Olympian (audiobook) by Rick Riordan Yay! Finally finished the series.

131627,"I've just been leafing through a new book called Extinct Birds* by Julian Hume and Michael Walters, published by Poyser. This is a subject that has always interested me, so I was excited to find this new title. At first glance this hefty catalogue of extinct bird taxa looks like the last word on the subject. It takes the form of a compilation of short accounts on the world's extinct birds - and interestingly, this book covers subspecies as well as species, and so provides information that has not previously been brought together. Unfortunately, after a few minutes I was disconcerted to find that the authors did not do the sort of exhaustive job that is essential in this kind of project. Looking through a handful of accounts, it became clear that important sources of information were not incorporated - and several subspecies seemed to be missing completely. Poyser used to be a wonderful imprint, publishing the very best information on (mostly British) birds, in volumes that have stood the test of time, which makes it all the more puzzling that this new title does not live up to that high standard. A huge amount of work has clearly gone into the research for the book, and it undoubtedly makes an important contribution to the subject, but is not authoritative enough to justify a place on my shelves at least - I'll wait for the second edition!

131818,"Last night I finished another of Pen & Sword's ""Roman Conquests"" series, ... Roman Conquests: GAUL --a good companion to read along with your copy of Caesar's Commentaries. Which reminds me that decades ago, my mother (the school teacher) and I drove from our country home to the Univ. of Alabama to see Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar."" We killed time at the university bookstore. It was there I got my first ""grown up"" military history volume: War Commentaries of Caesar, a paperback translation by Rex Warner. I had that book until it almost returned to cellulose! These days I have The Battle for Gaul - a HB illustrated by Barry Cunliffe. Caesar and his doings have generated a vast library of non-fiction and fiction through the centuries. Colleen McCullough turned him into an industry with her enjoyable series of novels. Caesar's military operations are covered by a plethora of authors over the years. Besides his The Civil War Julius Caesar, I still hold on to Osprey's short summary Caesar's Civil War by classical scholar Adrian Goldsworthy, and Jimenez' Caesar Against the Celts and Caesar Against Rome: The Great Roman Civil War. See also A NOISE OF WAR: CAESAR, POMPEY, OCTAVIAN AND THE STRUGGLE FOR ROME, interesting. There's a host of biographies out there, I prefer Caesar: Life of a Colossus and still retain Caesar by Meier. I'm sure everyone on this forum has their own favorite, happy reading!

131899,"I know I have not been a member here for very long, but I really love this group. The monthly themes and time periods are great and encourage me to pick up those historical books on my TBR stack. However, I sometimes regret that I cannot linger in a time period. I read one book for this groups theme each month, and if Im lucky I manage to squeeze in two. A month is sometimes just too short. At the same time, I noted during the last months of 2011 that several people regretted that the theme reads and time periods were all over the place  there was no chronological approach to reading through time. And I can imagine that as well. So I came up with the idea of maybe having quarterly theme reads here  like in the Reading Globally group  that are just time periods, and chronological in order. This would of course be next to the monthly themes/time periods, not instead of. By doing quarterly time reads, people who like to read chronologically through time can do so, and people like me who like to linger in a time period have plenty of time to read several books over the course of three months.  The way I envision this would be to make the time periods a little broader than the time periods we usually do in a month, so instead of 1920s it would be 20th Century before WW2, and instead of Gilded Age it could be 19th Century America. I have several time periods in mind and think we could cycle through them  so start with the earliest, continue down the list and when we reach the end we just start again.  Suggested time periods: Prehistory Ancient and Biblical Times  Arthurian Britain Medieval Europe (includes the Vikings) Renaissance 17th Century 18th Century Napoleonic Era 19th Century America (includes Civil War) 19th Century Europe The Old West 20th Century  Before WW1 20th Century  WW1 20th Century  Between Wars 20th Century  WW2 Also, I would think we could start this somewhere in February and just have the first quarterly theme read a little shorter, and then have the second one start in April. I would of course be happy to organize this  setting up a thread and making book suggestions. So, the real question of course is do you guys think this is a good idea? Would you be interested in doing this? And if yes, what do you think of the suggested time periods?

1388,"In lieu of the recent controversies in astronomy involving Pluto, asteroids, etc., I thought I would suggest a few LSF novels that bear on the topic. Robert Forward published a fun little novel a few years ago called Camelot 30K about First Contact with a civilization of small creatures, discovered inhabiting a body in the Kuiper Belt--the group of cold planetoids on the outer fringe of the Solar System of which Pluto is the best known member. The late Forward was not an explicit libertarian but is beloved by many LSF fans for his enthusiastic hard-science musings on space flight and space exploration. The Kuiper Belt is also featured in Poul Andersons wonderful LSF trilogy comprising Harvest of Stars, The Stars are also Fire and The Fleet of Stars. In those novels, the Belt is the next destination for humans and the human descended lunarians as they attempt to settle farther away from the growing power of the Earth based state. Robert Heinlein has his young protagonist journey to Pluto in the delightful Have Space Suit-Will Travel. Extremely dangerous and sinister sadistic-masochistic assassins from Plutos moon Charon, figure in John Varleys libertarian influenced The Golden Globe. Finally, L. Neil Smith, author of The Probability Broach, imagines a somewhat attractive but odd libertarian utopia on the terraformed asteroid Pallas in his novel of the same name. Pallas is the second or third largest asteroid in the asteroid belt. I recently read that its gravity is only 4% of Earths which Im not sure is described accurately in the story. Its an interesting book, though not as important as The Probability Broach or as fun as his Henry Martyn. Speaking of libertarian utopias, I have now decided that Pluto would be a good target. That lonely dwarf-planet would be far away from the long arm of government regulation, and its new lowered status (adopted, of course, by government supported astronomers) squares with my libertarian preference for scrappy individualist underdogs. Im not sure Ill make it, but perhaps my great grandchildren could enjoy capitalist provided ice cream cones under the cool and unpolluted Plutonian sky. :) Cheers Everyone!",no

13974,"So, I had an odd experience the other day that disturbed me. I was reading The Handmaid's Tale and I was thinking to myself that it was a really interesting dystopian novel in the vein of Brave New World or something and that I would recommend it to some men I know (enlightened feminists all of them) but that it was kind of a ""woman's book"" and maybe wouldn't appeal to them. This disturbed me for a number of reasons. I would never think twice about recommending a book by a man to a man or to a woman, especially if the kind of story was something I knew the individual in question would enjoy. I would recommend 1984 or Brave New World to anyone, even though they mostly focus on male characters. Although The Handmaid's Tale concentrates on women, it is also about the impact of a totalitarian state on people of all genders - think of the non-elite men or the male dissidents. What does it say if someone like me, who is pretty attuned to gender issues, still thinks of books featuring female protagonists as ""women's books"" and books featuring male protagonists as universal books?  Perhaps I'm making too much of this experience, but it left me unsettled.

14881,"You Call It Madness by Lenny Kaye The title is borrowed from Russ Columbo signature ballad ""You Call It Madness, I Call It Love"". And who is Russ Columbo. He was one of the crooners, the first balladeers to exploit the power of the microphone to put their softly phrased declarations of love directly in the listener's ear, as if the two, listener and crooner, are dancing cheek to cheek. Multiply that intimacy a few million times, with radio, with records, and you have the first intimate mass media experience. High fidelity amplification meant each word in a song could shaped perfectly and sung at murmur. It wasn't historonic belting, it was croooooning, smooth, velvety and low. You might confuse it with a clarinet. This book is a historical novelization of the rise of the crooner in the late '20s and early '30s, focusing on vivid characterizations of Bing Crosby, Rudy Vallee, and -- especially -- Russ Columbo. Columbo had the darkest, most sensual style of three, and he was murdered in his early thirties. (Cosby and Vallee transitioned fully to films) The book is written by Lenny Kaye -- musicologist, guitarist for seminal punk poetress Patti Smith and compiler of the influential Nuggets compilation of forgotten regional garage bands of the sixties. His writing style is idiosyncratic, leaning heavily on onomonopaies and jazzbo hipster slang, but he really hits his stride describing the performances of these men, the closeness of their voices and the warm tones of the backing orchestras that I found it easy to inhabit the space he protrays. His prose begs to be read aloud, which I did from time to time. It's a fasinating transport to a time that we've forgotten about.",no

Not love as an inner feeling, as a private sentimental emotion, but love as a dynamic power moving out into the world and doing something original Loving creatively. In business and in life it means the creative building of new structures, new relationships, and new solutions, new possibilities for our world that are rooted in love, a concern for the dignity and integrity and value of others in this life. This is the bedrock, the foundation on which any meaningful life must be built.. It runs through the proclamations of the great religious traditions. It defines the lives of saints. Its the attractive force within the scope of any genuine secular heroism. This is the absolute standard against which the relativities of our lives must be measured.  From a religious perspective, the deep appropriateness of this is rooted in that ultimate performance, which is the creation and ongoing maintenance of our universe, with all its cosmic splendor. Our creative performances are then to be thought of as reflections of the love that brought us into being. -- Tom V. Morris, If Aristotle Ran General Motors",no

Frankly, I know several graveyards where I could have a perfectly lovely picnic, but putting that aside, have you ever known anyone with this attitude? I'm pretty sure I've known lots of people who can't be bothered to read, but even my son, who loathes reading, says he doesn't identify with this statement.

I really identify with Wolfe here. So often when you just get settled in for a good read, some non-reader comes along and feels obligated to ""entertain"" you. ""What good is an obscenity trial except to popularize literature."" Amen. In my opinion that's the only reason some works became popular.

15919,"Any thoughts? The Road Home  It is time for the United States to leave Iraq, without any more delay than the Pentagon needs to organize an orderly exit.  Like many Americans, we have put off that conclusion, waiting for a sign that President Bush was seriously trying to dig the United States out of the disaster he created by invading Iraq without sufficient cause, in the face of global opposition, and without a plan to stabilize the country afterward.  At first, we believed that after destroying Iraqs government, army, police and economic structures, the United States was obliged to try to accomplish some of the goals Mr. Bush claimed to be pursuing, chiefly building a stable, unified Iraq. When it became clear that the president had neither the vision nor the means to do that, we argued against setting a withdrawal date while there was still some chance to mitigate the chaos that would most likely follow. While Mr. Bush scorns deadlines, he kept promising breakthroughs  after elections, after a constitution, after sending in thousands more troops. But those milestones came and went without any progress toward a stable, democratic Iraq or a path for withdrawal. It is frighteningly clear that Mr. Bushs plan is to stay the course as long as he is president and dump the mess on his successor. Whatever his cause was, it is lost. The political leaders Washington has backed are incapable of putting national interests ahead of sectarian score settling. The security forces Washington has trained behave more like partisan militias. Additional military forces poured into the Baghdad region have failed to change anything.  Continuing to sacrifice the lives and limbs of American soldiers is wrong. The war is sapping the strength of the nations alliances and its military forces. It is a dangerous diversion from the life-and-death struggle against terrorists. It is an increasing burden on American taxpayers, and it is a betrayal of a world that needs the wise application of American power and principles. A majority of Americans reached these conclusions months ago. Even in politically polarized Washington, positions on the war no longer divide entirely on party lines. When Congress returns this week, extricating American troops from the war should be at the top of its agenda. That conversation must be candid and focused. Americans must be clear that Iraq, and the region around it, could be even bloodier and more chaotic after Americans leave. There could be reprisals against those who worked with American forces, further ethnic cleansing, even genocide. Potentially destabilizing refugee flows could hit Jordan and Syria. Iran and Turkey could be tempted to make power grabs. Perhaps most important, the invasion has created a new stronghold from which terrorist activity could proliferate. The administration, the Democratic-controlled Congress, the United Nations and Americas allies must try to mitigate those outcomes  and they may fail. But Americans must be equally honest about the fact that keeping troops in Iraq will only make things worse. The nation needs a serious discussion, now, about how to accomplish a withdrawal and meet some of the big challenges that will arise. The Mechanics of Withdrawal The United States has about 160,000 troops and millions of tons of military gear inside Iraq. Getting that force out safely will be a formidable challenge. The main road south to Kuwait is notoriously vulnerable to roadside bomb attacks. Soldiers, weapons and vehicles will need to be deployed to secure bases while airlift and sealift operations are organized. Withdrawal routes will have to be guarded. The exit must be everything the invasion was not: based on reality and backed by adequate resources. The United States should explore using Kurdish territory in the north of Iraq as a secure staging area. Being able to use bases and ports in Turkey would also make withdrawal faster and safer. Turkey has been an inconsistent ally in this war, but like other nations, it should realize that shouldering part of the burden of the aftermath is in its own interest. Accomplishing all of this in less than six months is probably unrealistic. The political decision should be made, and the target date set, now. The Fight Against Terrorists Despite President Bushs repeated claims, Al Qaeda had no significant foothold in Iraq before the invasion, which gave it new base camps, new recruits and new prestige.  This war diverted Pentagon resources from Afghanistan, where the military had a real chance to hunt down Al Qaedas leaders. It alienated essential allies in the war against terrorism. It drained the strength and readiness of American troops.  And it created a new front where the United States will have to continue to battle terrorist forces and enlist local allies who reject the idea of an Iraq hijacked by international terrorists. The military will need resources and bases to stanch this self- inflicted wound for the foreseeable future. The Question of Bases The United States could strike an agreement with the Kurds to create those bases in northeastern Iraq. Or, the Pentagon could use its bases in countries like Kuwait and Qatar, and its large naval presence in the Persian Gulf, as staging points. There are arguments for, and against, both options. Leaving troops in Iraq might make it too easy  and too tempting  to get drawn back into the civil war and confirm suspicions that Washingtons real goal was to secure permanent bases in Iraq. Mounting attacks from other countries could endanger those nations governments. The White House should make this choice after consultation with Congress and the other countries in the region, whose opinions the Bush administration has essentially ignored. The bottom line: the Pentagon needs enough force to stage effective raids and airstrikes against terrorist forces in Iraq, but not enough to resume large-scale combat. The Civil War One of Mr. Bushs arguments against withdrawal is that it would lead to civil war. That war is raging, right now, and it may take years to burn out. Iraq may fragment into separate Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite republics, and American troops are not going to stop that from happening. It is possible, we suppose, that announcing a firm withdrawal date might finally focus Iraqs political leaders and neighboring governments on reality. Ideally, it could spur Iraqi politicians to take the steps toward national reconciliation that they have endlessly discussed but refused to act on. But it is foolish to count on that, as some Democratic proponents of withdrawal have done. The administration should use whatever leverage it gains from withdrawing to press its allies and Iraqs neighbors to help achieve a negotiated solution. Iraqs leaders  knowing that they can no longer rely on the Americans to guarantee their survival  might be more open to compromise, perhaps to a Bosnian-style partition, with economic resources fairly shared but with millions of Iraqis forced to relocate. That would be better than the slow-motion ethnic and religious cleansing that has contributed to driving one in seven Iraqis from their homes.  The United States military cannot solve the problem. Congress and the White House must lead an international attempt at a negotiated outcome. To start, Washington must turn to the United Nations, which Mr. Bush spurned and ridiculed as a preface to war. The Human Crisis There are already nearly two million Iraqi refugees, mostly in Syria and Jordan, and nearly two million more Iraqis who have been displaced within their country. Without the active cooperation of all six countries bordering Iraq  Turkey, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria  and the help of other nations, this disaster could get worse. Beyond the suffering, massive flows of refugees  some with ethnic and political resentments  could spread Iraqs conflict far beyond Iraqs borders.  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia must share the burden of hosting refugees. Jordan and Syria, now nearly overwhelmed with refugees, need more international help. That, of course, means money. The nations of Europe and Asia have a stake and should contribute. The United States will have to pay a large share of the costs, but should also lead international efforts, perhaps a donors conference, to raise money for the refugee crisis.  Washington also has to mend fences with allies. There are new governments in Britain, France and Germany that did not participate in the fight over starting this war and are eager to get beyond it. But that will still require a measure of humility and a commitment to multilateral action that this administration has never shown. And, however angry they were with President Bush for creating this mess, those nations should see that they cannot walk away from the consequences. To put it baldly, terrorism and oil make it impossible to ignore.  The United States has the greatest responsibilities, including the admission of many more refugees for permanent resettlement. The most compelling obligation is to the tens of thousands of Iraqis of courage and good will  translators, embassy employees, reconstruction workers  whose lives will be in danger because they believed the promises and cooperated with the Americans. The Neighbors One of the trickiest tasks will be avoiding excessive meddling in Iraq by its neighbors  Americas friends as well as its adversaries. Just as Iran should come under international pressure to allow Shiites in southern Iraq to develop their own independent future, Washington must help persuade Sunni powers like Syria not to intervene on behalf of Sunni Iraqis. Turkey must be kept from sending troops into Kurdish territories. For this effort to have any remote chance, Mr. Bush must drop his resistance to talking with both Iran and Syria. Britain, France, Russia, China and other nations with influence have a responsibility to help. Civil war in Iraq is a threat to everyone, especially if it spills across Iraqs borders.   President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have used demagoguery and fear to quell Americans demands for an end to this war. They say withdrawing will create bloodshed and chaos and encourage terrorists. Actually, all of that has already happened  the result of this unnecessary invasion and the incompetent management of this war. This country faces a choice. We can go on allowing Mr. Bush to drag out this war without end or purpose. Or we can insist that American troops are withdrawn as quickly and safely as we can manage  with as much effort as possible to stop the chaos from spreading.  -- NYT, 7/8/7 yes, rawREN, i know there will be an earful coming . . . :-)",no

My last few titles are as follows... Labyrinth by Mosse A Year in the Merde by Clarke The Book THief by Zusak and of Course.. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Anyone else surprised by how much or how little they have read so far this year?,no

I probably shouldn't have titled this ""Prehistory,"" since it deals with Roman history, but evidently it isn't possible to edit the name of a topic.",no
17089,"Did anyone here read gamebooks (a.k.a. Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books) when they were younger? Does anyone still? I was heavily into them. My favourite series were the Fighting Fantasy books, particularly the ones by the British Steve Jackson. I also liked the Lone Wolf, Grailquest and Blood Sword series. I had some US gamebooks such as the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure and Dungeons and Dragons series, but they were generally inferior to the UK ones. I have some gamebooks designed for adults too: You Are Maggie Thatcher, Whatever You Want and Life's Lottery. They are all a little strange. Does anyone know any other good adult gamebooks? In You Are Maggie Thatcher you play the British PM Maggie Thatcher (the book was published in the mid 1980s). It's written in a comic-book format. You have to please both the electorate (in order to win the election at the end of the book) and the right-wingers in the Tory party (otherwise they will get rid of you). It's not entirely serious. In Whatever You Want you play a well-off and somewhat amoral young 20-something living in London. You can play either a man (Barnie, who seems to be sex-mad and a bit dim) or a woman, Barbarella (who is mischievous and a bit reckless). The story takes place over the course of a weekend, which you can spend either in London or at a country house. The aim of the book is to end up with your ideal partner. I had much more fun (and success) playing Barbarella than Barnie. Since I'm a man, I'm not sure what that says about me. Life's Lottery is the longest and most serious of the three books. you play an Englishman called Keith Marion from birth (in Reading in 1959) to death. I have never been able to get to the happy ending in the last paragraph, and I wonder whether it is actually possible. I think the book is trying to make a point about how seemingly trivial decisions can have a huge impact on our future life.",na

17487,"Poems by Charles Simic      By CHARLES SIMIC Published: August 1, 2007 Late September The mail truck goes down the coast Carrying a single letter. At the end of a long pier The bored seagull lifts a leg now and then And forgets to put it down. There is a menace in the air Of tragedies in the making. Last night you thought you heard television In the house next door. You were sure it was some new Horror they were reporting, So you went out to find out. Barefoot, wearing just shorts. It was only the sea sounding weary After so many lifetimes Of pretending to be rushing off somewhere And never getting anywhere. This morning, it felt like Sunday. The heavens did their part By casting no shadow along the boardwalk Or the row of vacant cottages, Among them a small church With a dozen gray tombstones huddled close As if they, too, had the shivers. Paradise Motel Millions were dead; everybody was innocent. I stayed in my room. The President Spoke of war as of a magic love potion. My eyes were opened in astonishment. In a mirror my face appeared to me Like a twice-canceled postage stamp. I lived well, but life was awful. there were so many soldiers that day, So many refugees crowding the roads. Naturally, they all vanished With a touch of the hand. History licked the corners of its bloody mouth. On the pay channel, a man and a woman Were trading hungry kisses and tearing off Each other's clothes while I looked on With the sound off and the room dark Except for the screen where the color Had too much red in it, too much pink.  Country Fair for Hayden Carruth If you didn't see the six-legged dog, It doesn't matter. We did, and he mostly lay in the corner. As for the extra legs, One got used to them quickly And thought of other things. Like, what a cold, dark night To be out at the fair. Then the keeper threw a stick And the dog went after it On four legs, the other two flapping behind, Which made one girl shriek with laughter. She was drunk and so was the man Who kept kissing her neck. The dog got the stick and looked back at us. And that was the whole show. The White Room The obvious is difficult To prove. Many prefer The hidden. I did, too. I listened to the trees. They had a secret Which they were about to Make known to me-- And then didn't. Summer came. Each tree On my street had its own Scheherazade. My nights Were a part of their wild Storytelling. We were Entering dark houses, Always more dark houses, Hushed and abandoned. There was someone with eyes closed On the upper floors. The fear of it, and the wonder, Kept me sleepless. The truth is bald and cold, Said the woman Who always wore white. She didn't leave her room. The sun pointed to one or two Things that had survived The long night intact. The simplest things, Difficult in their obviousness. They made no noise. It was the kind of day People described as ""perfect."" Gods disguising themselves As black hairpins, a hand-mirror, A comb with a tooth missing? No! That wasn't it. Just things as they are, Unblinking, lying mute In that bright light-- And the trees waiting for the night. ",no

The other part of me says I'm being nitpicky. But that's partially what defines a geek. The grammarian in me does find it absolutely hilarious that one edition says ""Captain's Logs"" and the other says ""Captains' Logs"". (You can see on the covers that it is accurate.

While I appreciate that some tech publications are adamant that Firefox is more secure or safer than MS IE, that wasn't a big pull. Although, I'm sticking with XP, so I'm not interested in IE version 7. Was curious to try out the tabbed windows, one instance approach to browsing. Here are the two things I really like about Firefox: (1) When I am entering text in a browser app, like, um, LT, mis-spelled words are underlined in red. Very helpful for us who hate posting with spelling errors. (2) This may not be a big deal to others, but have you noticed how MS IE can get ""forced"" into opening in a small window, rather than in full-screen mode? I hate that. You can fix/control it for when you start IE directly, but if you click a link/URL in e-mail, etc. Once something has made it open up in small window, you can't clear that out.

I *hate* those damn yellow boxes that come up when you look at someone else's library. 2. Right now it only covers the columns in list view. You can't set cover view as your prefered style.

The book started out full of these quirky little sub-stories which were amusing, but it was getting to the point where I felt Murakami was just throwing in weird things into the pot for the hell of it. Chapters 11-28 really fleshed out the story, though! Now it's a full-fledged mystery, and I have to admit it wasn't easy to stop reading after Chapter 28. Because the characters act so Western, I forget sometimes that the story is set in Japan... and then I come across bits that are so Zen and I remember. I'm thinking about that bit in the first part of Chapter 12 where the main character talks about worm universes and his hypothetical conversation with a cow who was looking for pliers. What do you think that was about? I feel like there's something more there, but I still haven't figured it all out. And then there's that whole bit about the sheep entering the Sheep Professor. What was that about? I'm trying to find the meaning of the symbol, but sheep are just not very strongly associated with any concept. The first thing I think of is that sheep are typical examples of herd mentality. Maybe Murakami is trying to connect sheep with the Zen idea of community, the way Buddhists believe that there is no distinction between Self and Others.

We can take a look at the amount of sex in the genre. (How many books outside the YA section are complete prudes these days? Does sex really sell better in the sci fi/fantasy genre?) Which genre has sexier heroes/heroines/villains, science fiction or fantasy? Since anything is possible in the fantasy genre, what is the weirdest sexual encounter you've read in a fantasy book? Laurell K. Hamilton, for example, has some real humdingers -- a vampire and werewolf and wereleapord BDSM scene comes to mind.

Even as it is, it gives me great pleasure. I'd be delighted to hear of books on the subject. Thankfully just adding touchstones helps in the process. :) The crown of my collection is an enamel and 24-carat-gold service for five, from Thailand. I've forgotten what the name of the style is, and would be grateful to anyone who can remind me. The set is a gift from my father, the 'least masculine' he could find. It's intricately enamelled in shades of ivory, red, pink, blues, and green, with dull gold. As for the rest, there are three Yixing teapots: one variegated with a lizard, one with bamboo, and one simply very graceful in shape. Not unusual, but I enjoy looking at them - rather more than I use them, I'm afraid! I've often longed for a tetsubin, and been stopped by the price. However, I own a couple of generic Asian or Asian-influenced pots: one an elegantly shaped white pot with a bamboo handle and serious capacity - this has been much used; another set in a 'Chinese restaurant' design and lovely celadon green - which unfortunately dribbles; and a three-cup pot in a matte stone finish, with Japanese-styled cups - also much-used. It's a good size, sturdy, with a large enough mesh infuser.  Other than that, I have a Brown Betty, a couple of tea-for-ones packed away, and the remains of a few glass teapots. One of the glass pots is recent, and also much-used, though small. It's the only pot I've bought in several years, but the classic lines, material, and small price tag tempted me. Despite its lack of insulating quality, I do love glass for showing off a tea's color, reflecting light, and so forth. My Museum teapot took several years to crack, and I still hope to replace it, one day.  I'm curious what kinds of shapes, materials, derivations, features, or colors attract others to pots; where you get them; what you love most, and what you use. As I say, my own collection is a bit derelict, unplanned, and not added to recently: but teapots remain a continual pleasure and temptation.  I hope you're enjoying yours!

I can't count the number of times I've purchased a journal or notebook, only to get bored with it and stop. Maybe bored isn't the word... I just can't write fast enough to keep up with my thoughts, so I get frustrated. As much as I like the idea of writing longhand in a journal, it's just better and easier for me to type (part of being raised in the 80s/90s, I guess). I'm also paranoid about certain things being read, so that's another issue. If something happens to me, someone WILL find my paper journal, and there are just some things people don't need to know, even if I'm not around. I'm wondering who keeps a personal journal on their computer, and how they go about it? A simple Word document? A site like Livejournal? I do like LJ, and I could simply create another secret account and set it to automatically make all entries private, but it still makes me a bit paranoid. I'm currently using a Word document, but the nice thing about LJ is that you can change the style (I get bored easily) and you can also use tags, which I find very cool. And it's also backed up on external servers so if my computer crashes (I'm not so good about backing things up regularly), I won't lose everything. But... the paranoia! So, what do you do?

22403,"There are so many books for beginners, so many courses teaching basic grammar, but so few of both to help those nearing fluency to get there. And, believe me, you want to get there. Reading an exotic tongue in translation just does not hack it. When I was in graduate school, I had to create a special course for myself utilizing a tutor and side-by-side translations with (here was the reason for the tutor) explanations for Japanese. The books used were Tenseijingo. Because graduate level work is supposed to be analytical and learning skills such as reading counts for zilch, most students of Japanese (and, I would bet students of all tongues exotic with respect to English) never learn to read well, which, if you ask me, means they wasted years of study and tens of thousands of dollars. If schools do not help here, students must find readers for self-study. Since I have not been in a university for 30 years and am not involved with teaching Japanese, I do not know what if anything is available today for advanced students. All I can say is that my own books -- the ones I have written and published with over 8,000 haiku and senryu translations would have been one of the best readers I could have had back then. These books have the original, like Blyth's and the romanization and have something more, a gloss, which helps for tricky vocabulary, not to mention explanations which often (not always) try to pick up on things which might give most so-and-so readers of Japanese trouble. One of the books Rise, Ye Sea Slugs! was used in a comp. lit or Japanese lit course at CUNY and another (Cherry Blossom Epiphany) might be next spring but, to my knowledge, no one yet has introduced them to advanced students of Japanese to improve their reading skills. I would like to hear if anyone is using them in that way, or considering it. If anyone is using them, I would like to know which subject works better (sea cucumbers, cherry blossoms, flies, new year topics or sex). Also, I wonder what other advanced teaching aids are out there. Are there any readers interesting enough to be read over and over? Are there any really good cartoon books with notes for the difficult Japanese and abundant furigana?

Also of interest are the arguments among people -- by no means all conservatives -- who have some concept of human social evolution and who are trying to apply the lessons of the European past to Islamic societies today. Some of them hope to see the liberalization of Islam from within, and look to alliances with liberal Muslims -- good scope for irony here, by the way. Others want us to practice the same sort of ""realist"" enemy-of-my-enemy strategy that allied us with Death Squads against Communists three decades ago. But I am not so familiar with these tendencies so I have not tried to include any. There are at least two ""extreme"" conservative positions, and these I have included: One says: Islam is itself the enemy. The very nature of this religion, as compared to others, means that it cannot be reformed without changing fundamentally. The Islamists are its true interpreters. Robert Spencer is the most articulate advocate of this position and I have included some polemics and debates by and against and with him. Another says: we must ally with traditional Muslims against the cultural Left whose depravity has repelled them from the West, but who are not necessarily yet in the ranks of the radical Islamists.

As far as we can tell, I had a minor stroke about two years ago. I didn't know it at the time. I was working hard on Wintersmith and then immediately on Making Money and the fact that my typing seemed more erratic than usual I put down to hard work and, not to put too finer point on it, old age creeping on. It was only a couple of months ago that I was thinking about having an MRI scan, mostly because I had just typed a sentence that I couldn't understand! It appears to have been ""one of those things"". Frankly, over the years I have suffered from ""those things"" so often that I might as well check into the Royal Things hospital.

23086,"The purpose of this thread is to discuss/destroy the 1956 Hugo Winning Novel, Double Star, by Robert A. Heinlein.  WARNING, spoilers below! Read the book first if you want to participate in the discussion! ---------- Double Star is a fairly 'usual' novel for Heinlein (at least according to customary criticism), in that he has a fairly 'weak' female character; his protagonist is also both arrogant and unlikable (at least at the start of the story). Lorenzo, a professional actor (with a professional ego), is recruited/blackmailed to play the greatest role of his life: the impersonation of a very important Earth statesman during a critical, three-cornered diplomatic tour: Mars, Venus, and back to Earth. Lorenzo is infuriated and aloof; he considers his art timeless and politics below his attention; his captors are dubious about his prima-donna ways and his almost treasonous detachment from serious matters. Will Lorenzo torpedo the project, intentionally or accidentally, and destroy Earth's political prestige? Will Dak throw him out the airlock in frustration? Will someone see through the impostor and get the wrong (or right) idea? Will Bonforte regain his health and save the day? Will the 'girl' get the 'guy'? Does it matter?",no

23761," And my LT profile is: http://www.librarything.com/profile/shift_in_a_star 1 I love LibraryThing--but I've been using it for a while now, and even got a lifetime membership for a holiday present last year! I even showed it to my School Media class last semester, as a form of reader's advisory. I think the ""unsuggester tool is especially fun for that--challenge readers to prove the site wrong! I see this site as being more academic, with a little bit of social networking thrown in. To be honest, while I enjoyed Second Life, it's definitely not my favorite tool in the world. My computer didn't seem to like it at all, which was frustrating. I think Second Life can be a good balance between social and academic, or at least that's what I've seen. But I've also really only explored the educational sites, and haven't seen much of the social world of SL. I also use Facebook. One thing I love about Facebook is that it's extremely user-friendly. It takes nearly no skill to locate a person and friend him or her, which is definitely not the case with SL (or maybe I just feel that way because I'm a SL newbie). I see Facebook as being almost entirely social, though some of the groups lend themselves towards being more academic. I like LibraryThing and Facebook about equally, but for different reasons. I indulge my dorky side on LT, and my friends on this site are a couple librarians-in-training. Facebook is something I check daily to see if I've heard from friends, and I love it because I can get in touch with people I haven't seen since middle school--literally! This project has made me think about all three networking sites in the context of an educational setting, though, which is very interesting. I think they all could be used in that way, though I'd be worried about using Facebook or Second Life with students due to the perception of ""creepy people"" stalking young people on the Internet.  2 I thought everything about Second Life was interesting! My favorite part was the ability to go into history, like the Globe Theater or Paris in 1900. It's also a way to visit places that I would otherwise be too poor and busy to see in person. Like I said above, I would be hesitant to use SL with students, even the teen version, unless it were as part of a teacher-led tour, in which only one computer is being used to demonstrate for the class. I've volunteered with teen programs at a public library, and we had a conversation with a mother who did not want her daughter to use MySpace, even in a supervised setting where her profile was invisible, so she could join the library's MySpace group. I can't blame the mother, because if I had a child, I'd keep him or her off of social networking sites as long as possible! Here's my SLurl. I went exploring after the Paris tour, and found this great ""ride""! http://slurl.com/secondlife/Champs%20Elysee/31/70/25/ 3 LibraryThing is one of my favorite websites ever. One of my favorite things is the UnSuggester, which I've used to try to challenge the site. For example, the program thinks that because I've read The Body of Christopher Creed I won't like Stephen King, but it's wrong! I think that it would be a fun way to draw kids into reading, and broaden their horizons some. I was going to say that I think LibraryThing should add the ability to ""friend"" other members, rather than just adding them to a watch list, but I've discovered that they have added that feature since I last spent tons of time online (when I added most of my home library)! 4 I think that these technologies will definitely impact education and libraries. An obvious example is that I've heard of small libraries using LibraryThing to catalog their collections, rather than using an expensive software program. This would save those libraries money, which they could then put into improving their collections or programming. As I've said above, I would love to use LibraryThing in a classroom, but I think it'll be quite a while before Second Life or Facebook or MySpace catch on in that way, if they ever do. I think there are such negative images tied into these programs that it would be hard to find a classroom full of students whose parents approve of the use of these programs.",no
23818,"Washington Square started this group with the idea of promoting world peace on December 26, 2006 and it is coming up on its first birthday. He or she (that has never been determined and it really doesn't matter as it might be a cross-dresser or on its way to becoming another sex like a friend of mine who dresses like a woman but hasn't the money for hormone treatment nor breast implants yet, nor the very exotic operation known by some surgeons as ""the banana split) made themselves president by acclamation and I simply did the same. I realize it is not the right way to do things because there isn't a dictator in history who has wanted world peace through any method except conquering all the world's people and attempting to make them the same, like adolph (schickengruber) hitler did so attempt through extreme baking in the 1930s and 40s. Therefore, I propose an election of members who have signed in as of this date, plus any new members that sign in by december 20th, 2007. Right now there are nine of us and I invite Washingtonsquare to post his platform here at this thread as I am about to post mine. Remember: Dec. 20th is the cutoff date for joining and voting!  I vote for myself because The Mulching of America by Harry Crews is solid literature that shows the differences amongst as well as the sameness.  Name: Andyray Location: Central Florida Occupation: author, writer, machinery sales. Age: 64 Sex: Irrelevant Race: Irrelevant Education: M.A. in English Lit PLATFORM:  We should discuss the differences among us and how to accept those differences by understanding why they occur. To do this we should use literature, not just best-sellers. I will never foist a non-fiction nor a novel by Jackie Suzanne upon this club, instead showing my qualitative mind in using ""The Mulching of America,"" wherein you have black, dwarf, old white, young white, and middle-aged white people, as well as a situation (door-to-door selling) common in any society in the world. I'll even post my next book to be studied up front, depending on the throughness of discussion of Crews' book: ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" by John Kennedy Toole, named the National Book Award winner after it became published posthumously, and already acclaimed as ""literature"" by most English departments at most accredited universities. I will not take on Washingtonsquare as an opponent by slinging mud and such at his or her candidacy. I will not stress my three degrees (one with honors) against his attempts to enter college and failing to be (as I understand his postings) even a freshman at any school. I will not discuss his constant misfortunes with every branch of society he encounters compared with my kudoes of several writing awards, being published in more than 40 public media, and I certainly will not mention that he is from that area of smog, mould, and chaos called New Jersey, wherein I am born and raised in the beautiful spiritual mountains of upper New York State qnd have resided in the warm, gentle, and cultural climate of Florida since 1966. Things such as my honorable service during the Vietnam War, or my pretigious standing with Jimmy Carter and friendship with two Pultizer Prize winners should not be considered here. I am sure Washingtonsquare has his kudoes, also, so why should we bore any possible supporters with a fact that I am a card-carrying member of Mensa (although I haven't paid the dues for almost two decades) a member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the national Democratic Party, or Phi Teta Kappa? Certainly, the fact that I was President of my class at Daytona Beach Junior College and an Editor of The Flambeau at Florida State University should not enter into this campaign, nor should my awards from the Florida Press Association and FSU's editorial board for excellance matter. I look forward to Washingtonsquare's posting and the electoral count that should be completed by December 26th, 2007. I hope all those who join and vote by Dec. 20th will read the postings on all the threads herein and know the essential difference between my opponent's platform and my own, i.e.: Washingtonsquare believes that a world-wide peace can be accomplished by stressing the samenesses of each culture, while I maintain it can only be accomplished by promoting and accepting the differences within each culture by the other.

24090,"I think he captures the essence of the conservative dilemma. Source.  From the Los Angeles Times Ron Paul isn't that scary It's that over-do-gooder Mike Huckabee who should be making conservatives nervous. by Jonah Goldberg November 20, 2007 As the hopeless but energetic presidential campaign of Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) builds momentum in name recognition, fundraising and cross-ideology appeal, media conservatives are beginning to attack Paul in earnest. Republican consultant David Hill condemns the candidate's ""increasingly leftish"" positions. Syndicated columnist Mona Charen calls Paul ""too cozy with kooks and conspiracy theorists."" Film critic and talk radio host Michael Medved looks over Paul's supporters and finds ""an imposing collection of neo-Nazis, white Supremacists, Holocaust deniers, 9/11 'truthers' and other paranoid and discredited conspiracists."" For the most part, these allegations strike me as overblown and unfair. But, for argument's sake, let's say they're not. Let's even say that Paul has the passionate support of the Legion of Doom, that his campaign lunchroom looks like the ""Star Wars"" cantina, and that many of his top advisors actually have hooves. Well, I would still find him less scary than Mike Huckabee. While many are marveling at Paul's striking success at breaking out of the tinfoil-hat ghetto, Huckabee's story is even more remarkable. The former Arkansas governor and Baptist minister is polling in second place in Iowa and could conceivably win there. He's still a long shot to take the nomination and a pipe dream to take the presidency, but Huckabee matters in a way that Paul still doesn't. One small indicator of Huckabee's relevance: His opponents in the presidential race are attacking him while the field is ignoring Paul like an eccentric who sits too close to you on the bus. So what's so scary about Huckabee? Personally, nothing. By all accounts, he's a charming, decent, friendly, pious man. What's troubling about The Man From Hope 2.0 is what he represents. Huckabee represents compassionate conservatism on steroids. A devout social conservative on issues such as abortion, school prayer, homosexuality and evolution, Huckabee is a populist on economics, a fad-follower on the environment and an all-around do-gooder who believes that the biblical obligation to do ""good works"" extends to using government -- and your tax dollars -- to bring us closer to the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. For example, Huckabee has indicated he would support a nationwide federal ban on public smoking. Why? Because he's on a health kick, thinks smoking is bad and believes the government should do the right thing. And therein lies the chief difference between Paul and Huckabee. One is a culturally conservative libertarian. The other is a right-wing progressive. Whatever the faults of the man and his friends may or may not be, Paul's dogma generally renders them irrelevant. He is a true ideologue in that his personal preferences are secondary to his philosophical principles. When asked what his position is, he generally responds that his position can be deduced from the text of the Constitution. Of course, that's not as dispositive as he thinks it is. But you get the point. As for Huckabee -- as with most politicians, alas -- his personal preferences matter enormously because ultimately they're the only thing that can be relied on to constrain him. In this respect, Huckabee's philosophy is conventionally liberal, or progressive. What he wants to do with government certainly differs in important respects from what Hillary Clinton would do, but the limits he would place on governmental do-goodery are primarily tactical or practical, not philosophical or constitutional. This isn't to say he -- or Hillary -- is a would-be tyrant, but simply to note that the progressive notion of the state as a loving, caring parent is becoming a bipartisan affair. Indeed, Huckabee represents the latest attempt to make conservatism more popular by jettisoning the unpopular bits. Contrary to the conventional belief that Republicans need to drop their opposition to abortion, gay marriage and the like in order to be popular, Huckabee understands that the unpopular stuff is the economic libertarianism: free trade and smaller government. That's why we're seeing a rise in economic populism on the right coupled with a culturally conservative populism. Huckabee is the bastard child of Lou Dobbs and Pat Robertson. Historically, the conservative movement benefited from the tension between libertarianism and cultural traditionalism. This tension -- and the effort to reconcile it under the name ""fusionism"" -- has been mischaracterized as a battle between right-wing factions when it is a conflict that runs through the heart of individual conservatives. We all have little Mike Huckabees and Ron Pauls sitting on our shoulders. Neither is always right, but both should be listened to. I would not vote for Paul mostly because I think his foreign policy would be disastrous (and because he'd lose in a rout not seen since Bambi versus Godzilla). But there's something weird going on when Paul, the small-government constitutionalist, is considered the extremist in the Republican Party while Huckabee, the statist, is the lovable underdog. It's even weirder because it's probably true: Huckabee is much closer to the mainstream. And that's what scares me about Huckabee and the mainstream alike.",no

2513,"This is the text of a keynote speech given by Jayne Ann Krentz at the Bowling Green Romance Conference in August, 2000. I came across it today and just had to share it with all of you. Ms. Krentz, if you're out there somewhere looking in, I hope you don't mind my posting this here. And if you don't mind my saying so, YOU GO, GIRL!  CC ARE WE THERE YET? MAINSTREAMING THE ROMANCE I used to be a paranoid romance writer. I am proud to say that I have evolved. I am now a paranoid writer of popular fiction. What's the difference? Not much. Just a slightly broader view of the publishing universe.  During the twenty-odd (sometimes very odd) years that I have been writing romance and romantic-suspense, I have watched my genre take its rightful place alongside the other genres of popular fiction such as mystery and suspense, thrillers, science fiction, etc. The answer to the question, ""Are We There Yet"" for romance is, YES. It has, as they say in the marketing business, been mainstreamed.  How do I know this? By the same evidence that tells me that the other genres have been mainstreamed:  The books at the bestselling end of the market have moved from paperback into hardcover. The cover art at the bestselling end has become sophisticated and stylish. The books are now regularly reviewed in several newspapers and in such forums as Library Journal, Kirkus, Publisher's Weekly, People Magazine and USA TODAY.  Thanks to the legacy of librarian Alison Scott, the Popular Culture Library at Bowling Green State University collects romance with an eye toward serious future scholarly research. Around the nation public libraries now buy and catalog romance fiction for their popular fiction collections. (Never underestimate the importance of having your book in the public library, by the way. In our culture when it comes to legitimizing your writing there is no substitute for having a copy in the local library. Everyone knows that if a book is in the library, it is somehow a real book).  And, just as telling an indicator of success, the bestselling romance novels routinely appear on all the influential bestseller lists such as the New York Times, USA Today, Library Journal, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post Lists.  Folks, it doesn't get any more mainstream.  No, not everyone likes romance and not everyone approves of it. People still feel free to make disparaging remarks about it in my presence. The genre still takes a lot of flak in the media.  But I had a bunch of epiphanies a while back. And like everyone else who's ever had an epiphany, I can't resist telling you about mine. The first occurred when I overheard a conversation in the mystery section of a major downtown Seattle bookstore, a conversation that changed my life. Two women whom I did not know were standing there in front of the new hardcover mysteries, discussing whether or not to buy one of the books.  ""I read these once in a while when I want to relax,"" one of them said to the other in an apologetic tone. ""I know what you mean,"" the second woman said. ""I usually prefer to read something more substantial, of course, the sort of books that we discuss in my readers' club or the latest Oprah pick. But there are times when I just haven't got the energy to read that kind of thing. Times when I just want to read something light and entertaining.""  They hovered there in the mystery section for a while but in the end, neither of them had the courage to buy a mystery in front of the other. Both of them read mysteries but neither one wanted the other to think that she read them very often or that she did not understand that they were not significant books.  My next epiphany occurred when I fell into a conversation with some fellow Seattle authors at a book fair. Actually, it wasn't so much a professional discussion as a whine-fest. Let me assure you that when it comes to whining, no one does it better than an author. As it happens, I was the only romance author in this particular group. The others wrote mysteries, science fiction and horror - very successfully, I might add.  But you know what? Everyone in the group had the same kind of stories to tell - classic autographing horror tales- stories about the people who come through the autograph line, buy a book, and then, in a voice pitched loud enough to carry to the end of the line, assure you, the author, that they don't read this sort of book; they are buying it for elderly Aunt Mabel who just loves them.  Those same successful genre authors went on to tell other familiar horror stories, as well, stories about how their own relatives, their own mothers, in some cases who, when told that the author had just published a mystery or science fiction or horror novel uttered those immortal words: ""Well, that's nice, dear, but when are you going to write a real book?""  My third major epiphany occurred when I was asked to give a graduate seminar on romance fiction at the university from which I graduated. The seminar went wonderfully well - popular fiction being such a big thing in the academy these days. Afterward I went out to dinner with some of the professors and librarians and, after a couple of glasses of wine, everyone started talking about the books he or she really loved to read. Names like Stephen King and Dean Koontz and Robert Parker and Dick Francis and Tom Clancy and Ann Rice and Anne Perry and Patricia Cornwell were dropped freely around the table. All of these academics, it turns out, read popular fiction just like the rest of us. But every single one of them referred to those books not as GOOD READS but as GUILTY PLEASURES.  The truth is that the prejudice against romance fiction, while strong and virulent for generations and arguably exacerbated by the fact that the books are traditionally written by women for women -- that prejudice is actually nothing more than a particularly sharp extension of our culture's overall prejudice against the whole of popular fiction.  This bias begins in so-called creative writing classes taught in high school and college. Classes in which the instructors go to great lengths to insist that the only good fiction, the only kind of fiction worth writing, is the type that fits into the conventions and standards of modern literary fiction - conventions and standards that have been largely molded by modern psychological theory, existential philosophy, political correctness and a masculine style of writing that abhors sentiment and strong emotions - not by the ancient heroic traditions which shape and define the genres of popular fiction.  This prejudice extends throughout the academy and has trickled down, as things tend to do from the academy, into the media.  A major national business magazine recently profiled several successful bestselling authors from a variety of genres. And I can assure you that the tone of the article was just as sarcastic and snide about the well-known mystery and horror authors it featured as it was about the women's fiction and romance authors. The theme of all the profiles was the same: Look how much these folks make writing trash fiction.  The criticism of popular fiction -- romance in particular, has a long and extremely lurid history which I will not go into here. Suffice it to say that most of it takes the traditional view that anything that has a broad appeal is highly suspect from a literary point of view and anything that appeals mostly to women is even more suspicious.  But popular fiction -- romance, mystery, suspense, fantasy science fiction, horror and all the rest of the good stuff -- survives and flourishes in spite of all the negative press.  This is extremely fortuitous for the many folks who make careers out of criticizing it. Literary critics who don't understand the true significance of popular fiction face the same problematic future as dogs that like to chase cars. It's a great hobby as long as you don't actually catch one. Because in a one-on-one contest between cars and dogs, it's the car that wins every time. And I can assure you that in the eternal contest between critics and popular fiction, popular fiction wins every time.  This is especially true in romance fiction. Every romance reader knows what the critics and the media think of the books. As I have observed elsewhere it takes enormous courage to open a romance novel on an airplane.  But you know what? Women do it all the time.  Romance readers have guts. They have proved themselves to be astonishingly impervious to critics, feminist lectures on the evils of patriarchal societies and the scorn of the media. In recent years they have come out of the closet in the matter of their preferred reading material -- another indication of mainstreaming, by the way.  Interestingly enough, the vast majority of the readers and the writers call themselves feminists -- while making a clear distinction between their view of feminism and what they perceive as the politically correct, more strident, academic view.  Popular fiction has been around forever but rarely has it been viewed as important in and of itself. Rarely have we acknowledged that it has a crucial place in culture. Rarely have we come to terms with the fact that popular fiction is not simply a degraded form of literary fiction, meant only for light entertainment and not to be taken seriously.  The truth is, popular fiction - mysteries, science fiction, sword and sorcery, fantasy, glitz, romance, historical saga, horror, tecno-thrillers, legal thrillers, forensic medical thrillers, serial killer thrillers, westerns, etc. - popular fiction is its own thing. It stands on its own. It draws its power from the ancient heroic traditions of storytelling - not modern angst.  It is important, even if it is entertaining.  It has its own tasks and those tasks are separate from and different from the tasks of modern literary fiction. Furthermore, it is wrong to use the standards of one to judge the other. It's like comparing apples and oranges.  Every genre of fiction, popular or literary, is defined, not by its backgrounds, its settings or the trendy issues that are dealt with in the stories, but by the fundamental focus of those stories - the one driving storytelling element that you could not remove from the book and still have a viable story left that would be acceptable to the majority of the readers and the informed critics of that particular type of fiction.  In mysteries, there must be a mystery to be solved. No matter how convoluted the plot, no matter how much psychodrama in the tale, no matter how alienated or dysfunctional the protagonist, a successful mystery story must solve the crime. Justice must be done to maintain the all-important illusion of order and balance in the universe.  Fantasy, horror and the hot new genre of Christian apocalyptic novels that fail to pit good against evil in stark, larger-than-life terms, are pretty much guaranteed to bomb in the marketplace. Science fiction that fails to deal with the big question of whether or not humans will make it in this universe at least as long as the dinosaurs did, will crash and burn.  The romance novel that fails to bring about a positive resolution to the conflicts and problems inherent in the formation of a strong bond between the hero and heroine and then use that bond to establish a solid family foundation for the next generation of humans will disappoint readers.  Romance novels are, at their core, WOMEN'S VALUES BOOKS. Among other things, they celebrate those ancient nurturing values so long associated with our gender. That is, of course, one of the things that makes them so dang politically incorrect.  But it is important to note that romance fiction celebrates the masculine as well as the feminine and, perhaps more importantly, it demands respect for the heroic aspects of both genders. Future scholars will discover that romance was the one area of women's fiction that did not sink into a quagmire of endless and ultimately pointless male-bashing during the feminist-influenced years of the seventies and eighties -- the days when the theme of most of the critically approved novels in the field of women's fiction was in sync with that infamous slogan, a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.  In romance novels women understand perfectly that they CAN exist without men. They know very well that they don't need a man to take care of them. That is never the issue in a romance novel. It is not the point of the books. Romance novels that try to make that statement in a loud way never do well in the genre because that is not why the reader comes to this kind of fiction.  What is important to the reader in a romance novel is a recognition on the part of both the hero and the heroine that the possibilities that can be realized when they take the emotional risk of forging an enduring bond transcend what either can achieve alone.  At least some partial resolution to the natural problems and conflicts between men and women is necessary, not only for the happy ending in the books, but for the continuation of the species and the survival of civilization.  A romance novel that ends with the hero and heroine going their separate ways or in death and destruction has failed as a romance. It might be an excellent book in another genre, but it will not satisfy the expectations of the romance genre. It would be the equivalent of writing a mystery in which the mystery was not solved. It can be done but it is another kind of novel when it is finished.  My friend, Ann Maxwell, who writes as Elizabeth Lowell has observed that genres can be understood by an examination not just of what is allowed into them, but, perhaps even more significantly, of what is not allowed into them. The modern literary genre - and, yes, literary fiction is a genre - you know it when you see it (heck, it even has its own cover art) - has its own rules and conventions, just as the other categories of fiction do.  Much of what is not acceptable in the literary genre - the heroic, the mythic, the romantic, the larger-than-life elements, the character who uses the classic heroic virtues to overcome his or her own flaws in order to do what must be done - those are precisely the elements that lie at the very heart of the popular fiction genres.  Concepts like HONOR matter in popular fiction. Courage matters. Determination matters. These are ancient, heroic virtues. They do not derive from modern psychological theory or the social dictates of political correctness. What's more, they are infused with enormous survival value for individuals, families and communities.  The literary genre, on the other hand, tends to focus on an intimate examination of characters who are victims, either of their own flaws or their dysfunctional childhoods. It dissects and explores in often painful detail neuroses, psychoses, obsessions, depression, sexual dysfunction and other frequently destructive aspects of the human condition.  Popular fiction gets involved in this stuff, too, of course.  You've got your classic hard-boiled private eye who is fighting a never ending battle with alcoholism, a tradition that goes back to Sherlock Holmes and his famous flirtation with cocaine.  You've got your traditional half-human-half-alien or maybe half-human-half-machine science fiction character who must struggle with the part of himself that does not exactly fit in with the crowd and all of the very human sense of alienation and angst that involves.  And then there's the ever popular ex-cop who accidentally killed a child on the job and who has quit the force and vowed never to take up his guns again but who must confront his own past when he is forced to vanquish the evil villain who must be destroyed in order to protect - yes - another innocent child.  You've got your hugely popular character who, while busily coping with a history of child abuse or a traumatic divorce, must outwit a serial killer.  There is the decent character of shaky or non-existent religious faith who suddenly finds himself confronting genuine evil -- and the possibility of genuine good.  There is the classic female character whose dysfunctional childhood makes it difficult for her to trust a man or to take the risk of falling in love.  There is the male character who lost his wife and child and will not take the chance of making himself emotionally vulnerable again to a woman's love.  And so it goes, generation after generation of flawed, emotionally vulnerable heroes and heroines who are the heart and soul of both popular and literary fiction.  But the difference is that in popular fiction, these characters must triumph. They must find a positive resolution to their problems. When the chips are down, they must do the right thing. The mystery must get solved, justice must be done, good must win the battle with evil. Men and women must find a way to deal with their natural conflicts so that a new family can be founded and civilization will be saved.  Call me a nave dupe of those wack jobs who are busily irritating everyone with their new theories of evolutionary biology and psychology, but my brain and my feminine intuition both tell me that these values survive and endure because they are core survival values for our species. They live and breathe and thrive and get affirmed anew for each generation in popular fiction.  Literary fiction, on the other hand, does not concern itself with seeking positive resolutions to these problems. It does not usually take that as its task. The job of modern literary fiction is to illuminate and examine these things, not to resolve them or to affirm the possibility of triumph over them. That is the primary reason why a happy ending is so darn rare in literary fiction.  In the course of our lives we all need both kinds of fiction, popular and literary, but most of us, readers and writers, alike, tend to develop a preference for one over the other. Our choices say more about our own personal philosophies and world views, our sense of optimism and hope and our belief in the future than they do about either our intelligence or our education.  We are attracted to a particular type of fiction, popular or literary, because something in it affirms our core values and our most fundamental, deeply held convictions.  There is nothing right or wrong about either popular or literary fiction. They do have different goals, however, and if you would truly appreciate popular fiction, not just as entertainment, you must understand its unique tasks.  Literary critics often criticize popular fiction -- romance in particular -- because it is not ""realistic"". But that is a ludicrous criticism which completely misses the point. It is not the task of popular fiction to be realistic. It may feel realistic on occasion. The settings or emotions and psychological motivations of the characters may feel very real, especially in a contemporary story. And the best writers are good at invoking that feeling of realism. But that is not the same things as being real.  I'd like to mention that this critical emphasis on the importance of realism is a very new phenomenon in the arts - and you will note that critics usually apply it only to books. Realism is certainly not considered an important asset in the visual arts such as paintings, sculpture or -- as anyone who has ever posed for a photo for the back cover of her book can tell you -- photography. Nor is it considered important in the other arts such as film, opera, theater or dance.  Just books.  The point is, all fiction is based on fantasy. That's why it's called fiction, folks.  And just as the average reader of Robert Parker's hardboiled private eye novels does not finish a book and rush out to apply for a private investigator's license, the average romance reader does not confuse fantasy and reality, either. Romance readers and readers of popular fiction in general are experienced readers in every sense of the word. They understand intuitively how fiction works.  Not everyone does, you know. When Bridges of Madison County came out a few years back it was a media sensation and as such it attracted a lot of folks who were not experienced fiction readers. As a result the National Geographic Magazine was inundated with requests for copies of the issue that had the cover that the hero of the novel had supposedly photographed for the magazine. These inexperienced readers did not understand that the book was a work of pure fiction.  Romance readers and others who read popular fiction regularly did not make that mistake.  Another criticism of the romance novel is that the stories are deemed to be similar, even repetitious in terms of theme and plot and character.  For some odd reason this common criticism is usually limited to the romance novel. It fails to take into account that familiar fantasy worlds that can be reentered again and again are the mainstay of all popular fiction. Why do you think so many mystery, suspense and fantasy science fiction authors have managed to build such enduring careers on series characters and series worlds?  The truth is, when people read for pleasure, they tend to read along narrow lines. So narrow, in fact, that well established genres usually have dozens of sub-genres. And the audience for those sub-genres is often not terribly adventurous. When people are reading for personal pleasure, they tend to stick to their preferred fictional landscapes.  Fans of hard-boiled American private eye novels, for example, often won't read what are termed ""cozies"" -- those books characterized by small town settings, quirky characters and a detective who does not come out of traditional law enforcement milieus.  Readers of cozies, on the other hand, often have no interest in reading police procedurals -- which are, in turn, broken down into American style police procedurals and British style police procedurals. Fans of one type of procedural often won't touch the other.  Writers often get trapped in a successful series and will try anything to escape. Why do you think Conan Doyle tried to kill off Sherlock Holmes? If you read Robert Parker's mysteries, you want his archetypal hero, Spenser. If you read Clive Cussler, you want his archetypal hero, Dirk Pitt. If you read Robert Jordan you want the next adventure in his Wheel of Time series. If you read Ann Rice you want vampires. If you read Patricia Cornwell you want Kay Scarpetta.  The desire on the part of readers to revisit familiar landscapes has another element. Each genre and sub-genre develops its own core language and core landscapes. Readers and writers alike become fluent in that language and that landscape.  This is not to say that each writer does not create his or her own version and variations of the language and landscape but if you are a writer, you soon learn that if you would write successfully for readers who love a particular genre or sub-genre, you need to know the shared elements that are its heart and soul. You need to respect those elements and the readers, as well. The one unbreakable rule for a writer of popular fiction is that you must respect your chosen genre and the readers in it. You must write your stories with absolute conviction or you will never have a successful career.  By the way, those of you out there who are still searching for a topic for a paper or a dissertation -- you know who you are -- pay attention. I think there's a good one here in this business of genre language and landscapes.  Fans of sword and sorcery fantasy books, for example, have developed a language and landscape that borrows heavily from the medieval and the Celtic traditions. The books are often infused with strong elements of Arthurian mythology and the imagery of the medieval church. The larger-than-life clashes between good and evil are often told in quasi-religious language and images. As a writer you must know this language and landscape or you will come across as an outsider.  Fans of serial killer thrillers -- a huge sub-genre in the suspense category -- have developed a very sophisticated knowledge of the language and landscape of that world, too. They know the difference between organized and disorganized killers. They know about FBI profiling. They know about the link between serial killing and childhood sexual abuse and they know why prostitutes are so often victims of these monsters. They've picked up a lot of cop lingo. Writers must know and respect that knowledge.  Those who write romance know that the genre, blessed as it is with a vast universe full of sub-genres, has developed a host of highly descriptive languages and a wide variety of landscapes.  The language of the romance is rich in its ability to describe intense emotion, strong sensual attraction, and acute physical awareness. In addition, readers love the language of communication between hero and heroine. They love the repartee and the word play. They enjoy watching the bonding process take place on the verbal and psychic planes as well as in the physical realm.  Communication is key to the success of a romance novel. That is one of the elements that the American writer has brought to the books in recent years in my opinion -- a more entertaining, more modern, more sophisticated kind of communication between hero and heroine. Readers love it. (Another academic paper or dissertation topic here, I think).  The landscapes of the romance novel are more varied than those of most of the other genres and, unlike the other genres, readers tend to move quite readily between sub-genres. The settings range from small towns to big cities. From ranches to corporate boardrooms. Popular time periods include Medieval, Regency, Western, Victorian and the distant future with all of the highly descriptive trappings and mythology that go with those periods. Other worlds, alternate universes, time-travel, magic, gothic horror and New Age metaphysics abound.  The romance reader not only moves more easily between sub-genres than readers in other genres do, she also tends to read widely outside the genre. Start a conversation about books with a romance reader and you're likely to end up talking about the latest titles in mystery, suspense, fantasy and horror. This versatility is one of the reasons why several writers who got their start in the romance genre were able to move so successfully into the suspense and thriller genres. Sandra Brown, Tami Hoag, Kay Hooper and Iris Johanson are just a few examples. They were able to take huge chunks of their romance audience with them when they made the move.  Writers in other genres are rarely so fortunate. Just ask some who have tried to shift gears to write in another genre. More often than not, their audiences have not followed them.  This is one of the many things I love about the romance reader. She is an adventurous reader; an expert reader.  If you write a New York city police procedural story and throw a vampire into the novel, your average big city police procedural fan will return the book to the bookstore and demand that his money be returned. The reader who cut her teeth in the romance genre, will keep reading.  The stories in popular fiction offer warnings about wrong choices and support the concept of doing the right thing. They are morality plays. They offer hope for the future. They give us a sense of transcendence by illustrating the ancient heroic qualities of honor, courage and determination, and by reminding us that we can and should use these qualities to overcome our very human flaws and weaknesses. They teach us that we need not be victims of those flaws and weaknesses.  Being a victim has no survival value. The courage to overcome one's victim-hood, on the other hand, has enormous survival value. Popular fiction keeps alive the goal of overcoming the past and the belief that the future can be changed for the better. And in the romance novel, it celebrates the ancient, heroic feminine values and the possibilities that emerge when a man and a woman bond together to create a new family.  As a writer, I see the genres as a circle of deep well springs which together fill a vast pool. The pool, itself, is the whole of fiction, both popular and literary. In the past, many things have disturbed the surface waters of this great pond. Contemporary trends and problems, issues of political correctness, new theories in psychology and science and various social agendas. These disturbances have created ripples which spread out but which do not sink deep. They do not affect the great rushing waters of the wellsprings at the bottom of the pool.  These ripples, however, serve to refresh and renew the power of the genres for readers and writers alike on a regular basis.  As an example of this, consider the mystery genre. Over the years we've had mysteries that feature private investigators who were ex-alcoholics and burned out war veterans. Detectives of various ethnic background, lesbian and gay detectives. Detectives who are blind. Detectives who are cloistered nuns or eleventh century Benedictine monks. Politically correct detectives, fiercely feminist detectives, etc.,etc.  But the detectives who survive in popular fiction are the ones with heart; those who use the heroic virtues -- courage, honor, determination -- to get at the truth and who do not stop until justice is done. The rest go by the wayside in a hurry -- or else find their way into the literary genre.  We've had several ripples in the surface waters above the deep wellspring of romance, too. Political correctness and feminism have created lots of splashes. In the years that I have been writing we've seen a host of books in which the heroines confront serious social issues such as alcoholism, child abuse, rape and dysfunctional families.  New settings and venues have also been added. There are books in which the characters travel back and forth in time. Books in which the heroines have paranormal powers. Books in which they know karate and pack a gun and hate to wear dresses.  But the romance heroines who survive are those who have heart: the ones who use the heroic virtues -- courage, honor, determination -- to achieve their goals.  The ripples on the surface of the great pool of fiction come and go. As I said they're useful and important because they serve to refresh and renew the various genres, romance included. But at their heart, the genres do not change very much because the ancient, heroic traditions and archetypes that give them their power do not change.  And in the modern world where everything is routinely explained in terms of dysfunctional families and private neurosis, readers come to popular fiction for stories that celebrate the ancient, heroic virtues, the larger-than-life characters and a belief in the healing power of love.

This action was often arbitrary.  2. Most other characters in these novels obliviously went about their lives trying their best to follow these arbitrary, unfair rules.

26549,"There's just insufficient action around here, so I'm compelled to start another thread along the lines of my last. These are poular songs that reference historical events. Don McLean's 'American Pie' is a given of course. One of my favorites is 'Roads to Moscow' by Al Stewart from his 'Past, Present, and Future' album from '74. It is a story of a Russian soldier fighting the Germans during WWII from the opening of Barbarossa to the taking of Berlin. The KGB question him about his brief capture and he soon finds himself heading off to Siberia instead of home. The music perfectly evokes the landscape and the desolation of combat. In my head I have stored my own personal video to go with the song. Stewart wrote a number of songs about history. WWII was an event that profundly affected his life as it did many Europeans. (Americans who did not actually go to war can't appreciate the dangers and privations faced by those in the midst of war.) There is also a song called 'Zoot Suit Riot' (I forget by whom) that references the fight at Long Beach, CA between Navy yard workers (or was it actual sailors?)and Mexican kids who affected the zoot look of black Americans in '43 (I think.) The Band's 'The Night They Drove Dixie Down' tells a personal story of the final days of the American Civil War. Written by a Canadian, oddly enough. Closer to home they recorded 'Acadian Driftwood' about the French driven from Canada by the British way back when. Randy Newman's 'Louisiana, 1927' tells the story of that flood. The song is covered well by Aaron Neville.  These are all songs from 30+ years ago, so they are themselves history. There are more. Are there also more current songs in this vein?

27070,"I've been keeping track of what I read for several years, but thought I might join you all this year. My 2008 goals: 1. I don't like giving myself a goal for number of books read, because it tempts me to read shorter books, but I aim to read an average of 100 pages a day, or 36,600 over the course of the year. 2. Less than half (41 out of 95) of the books I read in 2007 were books I already owned going into the year. Id like to up that to 60% this year. 3. Id like to read 25 books of nonfiction this year (up from 19 in 2007). I find myself enjoying nonfiction more and more as the years go by, but I still turn to fiction first when I'm picking out my next book. (This goal is going to make goal #1 harder, by the way, and I was tempted to lower my page-count goal, but heck--it's not like the reading police will come and get me if I don't make all my goals!) 4.

27094,"Who are the contemporary male novelists writing about what it means to be a man in our modern world? Im interested in novels dealing with masculinity, but not in a shallow machismo sense. Im talking about something along the lines of a contemporary Hemingway, but not in the way his characters strove to prove or validate their manhood. His grace under pressure was artificially induced. He placed his characters in extraordinary circumstances in order to test their mettle. Im more interested in a sensibility that tries to show how difficulties and conflict arising from everyday life are met and overcome with grace, with a toughness which doesnt preclude empathy for others and avoids self-obsession. Im looking for male characters who are concerned with values, fairness and justice, with a manliness not only encapsulating strength and toughness but also acknowledges the need for reliance on others. Maybe this is asking a lot, but hopefully you catch my drift. Any suggestions or recommendations of novels and novelists who might meet these criteria would be greatly appreciated. ",yes

I thought you might all want to shake your head as I have.  http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/01/no_way_to_run_a_bookstore.php  I love bookstores  I like the ones that have huge stacks of strange used books where you can find surprises, and I also like the big online stores where I can order anything I want. My kids are all the same way; when we make trips into the big city, the whole mess of us usually end up spending hours in places like Cummings or Uncle Hugo's. But I finally found a bookstore with no redeeming values at all, one I will never patronize. It's called Abunga, and their motto is ""Empowering Decency as your Family Friendly Bookstore"". What that means is that they allow bookstore members to vote against books, and if enough people reject a book, the store removes it from its database. This makes no sense to me. There are a lot of books that I deplore, and the way I cope with them is that I don't buy them. I don't go to the manager and tell them that no one else should be allowed to buy them. So of course one set of books already banned is Pullman's His Dark Materials. Looking around the site, it seems that they're mainly pushing is religious pablum, naturally enough.  It seems a small thing, but that's what you get when you give a religious cult majority rule  it's not an opportunity for them to relax and enjoy their culture, but a reason to suppress minority views.

As usual, on ordering tea, I'm excited and have that slight sinking fear - what if the teas I've just ordered DON'T prove, in the next couple of months, to be what I want to drink?!

Here's the link to imdb. http://imdb.com/title/tt0452694/ Apparently Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams are the leads. Their work has been mixed in previous films. Robert Schwentke is the director and Jeremy Leven adapted the screenplay. I can't say that I've seen any of their films.  My fear is that the film will be more of a schmaltzy sappy ""chick flick"" rather than reflect the complex and sometimes dark book. If reviews end up saying as much, I can't see the film. I just like the book too much. This was one of those rare books that I just got completely absorbed into. I got attached to the characters and the world of the novel and was sad when I had to leave it. I still have a particular feeling when I think about the book and I don't want it to be ruined by seeing a crappy film. I'm interested in the music they use for it, though. Henry was into the punk scene, if I recall, so let's hope for lots of that. I was listening to a lot of Death Cab for Cutie at the time, though, and their song ""The New Year"" seems to perfectly fit the tone and themes of the book--let alone the obvious connection with the important recurring holiday of New Year's in the book.

29121," In an article in Salon, Prof Juan Cole has some interesting things to say about Islam bashing and whether it has legs for presidential candidates. http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/02/01/islamophobia/ But I'm a two handed philosopher when it comes to the following, which is only a small part of his article. In fairness, one should read the whole thing to counter any bias I may have inadvertently introduced by snipping out this bit:   QUOTE ""Islamic"" has to do with the religion founded by the prophet Mohammed. We speak of Islamic ethics or Islamic art, as things that derive from the religion. ""Muslim,"" on the contrary, describes the believer. It would be perfectly all right to talk about Muslim terrorists, but calling them Islamic terrorists or Islamic fascists implies that the religion of Islam is somehow essentially connected to those extremist movements. END QUOTE Disclaimers and anti flame stuff: Now, just to be clear, I fully acknowlege and heartily agree that citizens have the perfect right to belong to believe in and to practice any religion whatsoever so long as they obey the laws of the land, and that there should be no religious qualification for any office or place of trust in the US.  I would go further and say that beyond what the constitution provides, as a matter of common decency and civilization, no one should be subject to social , financial , or other pressures in any sphere because of his or her association to a particular faith, creed, or cult. On the other hand, I reserve the right to make great mock of foolishness as I see it, and understand that that gives the object of my ""wit"" (if thats what it is) free license to fire back in kind.  End disclaimers and anti flame stuff As regards prof Coles piece: 1. I'm not so sure that the academic usage of the terms Islamic (meaning of the religion) vs Mulsim (meaning of the people) holds for civilians 2. Its not clear to me that the current crop of nasty ones from the Islamic (Muslim?) community do not in fact have a pretty good claim that their beliefs are in fact justified by the literal word or traditional interpretation of the word of the Koran.

As you can see, I don't read as voraciously as many others here, but I think I can manage fifty books this year. We'll see. Read so far this year: 1. His Majesty's Dragon by Naomi Novik Best described as ""Master and Commander with fire-breathing dragons."" (Note: I have not yet read Master and Commander, but would very much like to once a Kindle edition is released.) A well-researched alternate world in which England's Flying Corps must fend off Bonaparte's ships and dragons. The author has the admirable restraint to make the dragons just one branch of the service; it's literally the historical world, just as if there were also dragons. Unfortunately, this also feels very much like the first novel in a series. Much of the book is devoted to training and establishing characters and milieu. Dragged a bit here and there. I enjoyed it, though, and the finale was everything it should have been. 2. The Turkish Gambit by Boris Akunin This is the second in Akunin's series about the turn-of-the-century Russian detective Fandorin. I loved the first book, The Winter Queen, which was a perfect parody of a Holmesian murder mystery, though the twist in the last couple of pages hurt. ""The Turkish Gambit"" was a bit less entertaining, as it focuses on a young woman and her experiences in a war camp with an international band of reporters. Entertaining in its own right--with some biting commentary--but quite different than ""The Winter Queen."" 3. Flatland by Edwin Abbott More a thought experiment than a proper novel, much of ""Flatland"" is taken up with descriptions of life in a two-dimensional world. There is a bit of a plot, but the book is mostly about describing a logical world full of people, vegetation, etc. but which lacks a third dimension, and how that would work. It wonderfully suggests what it might be like to experience a person from a fourth dimension invading our third, with fascinating implications for religious experience. The book's also written in that unselfconsciously pompous manner of many eighteenth century novelists, which is fun. 4. In the year 2889 by Jules Verne A breathless description of the future one thousand years out. Wonderful to think of people over a hundred years ago with that breadth of vision. As typical for Verne, his ideas are reasonable, given many more centuries of uninterrupted technological progress. It's not really a novel; it follows a millionaire through one typical day in his life, as he has videophone conversations, judges new inventions, and manages his empire. I'm currently making my way through half a dozen books; ""Flight of the Mind"", By Right of Conquest, Tea with the Black Dragon, Bulfinch's Mythology, Murder on the Leviathan, Halting State.",no

30009,"January 1. Elizabeth Gilbert- The Last American Man (A) I rated this one five stars. I had read Eat, Pray, Love by Gilbert last year and fell in love with the work and the author. I was fascinated by the story of Eustace and could not put this one down. I also liked that Elizabeth was a somewhat active part of the story and not just a blind narrator.  2. Deborah Rodriguez- Kabul Beauty School (B) Enjoyable but not particularly memorable. Sometimes the narrator would get on my nerves.  3. Robert Mack- Sweeney Todd (B+) Really loved both the book and the movie, even though they were quite different. The book was a quick read and recommended. 4. Douglas Coupland- The Gum Thief (A) What can I say, I'm a huge Douglas Coupland fan. It was funny and entertaining and the characters were real and memorable.  5. Stephen Chbosky- The Perks of Being a Wallflower (A-) Didn't see the spoiler coming and not sure I thought it added anything to the book. As someone who works with this age group, the dialog rang true and the narrative voice was authentic. Somehow it managed to be both funny and depressing.  6. Jay Asher- Thirteen Reasons Why (B) Young adult novel about a girl who kills herself and leaves behind thirteen audio tapes for the people she feels helped seal her decision to end her life. Moving and entertaining. You really felt like you knew the characters and were taking this journey along with them. Click here for my review 7. Thrity N. Umrigar- The Space Between Us (B) Ehhh..Reading it I couldn't put it down. Once I did finish it, I easily forgot about it. A sad story with an even sadder, terrible ending. Very hard to read at times.  8. Jim Crace- Quarantine (D) Book club book that I just couldn't get into. A lot of violence against women and animals, which I cannot read about.  ",no

One passage in particular really stood out to me: ""Out of warrens in the wall, tiny robot mice darted. The rooms were acrawl with the small cleaning animals, all rubber and metal. They thudded against chairs, whirling their mustached runners, kneading the rug nap, sucking gently at hidden dust. Then, like mysterious invaders, they popped into their burrows. Their pink electric eyes faded. The house was clean."" So keeping in mind that the first copyright of this book was 1946, I think I figured it out. Ray Bradbury invented the Roomba. ;)",no

30623,"I came across this author in an anthology I'm going through slowly called Voices of Liberty. I'd never heard of her, but enjoyed the story. Coincidentally, even before I got to the story in the anthology, a woman I met by chance at a jazz club looked this book over and said, ""Oh, it has an Anzia Yezierska story in it! She was a very well known writer about the Jewish immigrant experience!""  Alerted to who Yezierska was by this chance encounter, I paid special attention to the story (""The Fat of the Land"") and enjoyed it immensely. It turns out she was, indeed, very popular in the early part of the 20th Century, and even had her work turned into movies. So today I went to a couple of used book stores in my neighborhood of San Francisco. I was blown away by the coincidence of finding her short story collection ""Hungry Hearts"" in the bargain rack of the first store (and a 1920 first edition, at that) and a biography of her written by her daughter in the second store!

30672,"You've no doubt read my posts about my work, and some of you no doubt object to them as self-promotional SPAM. I'm sorry if I've offended anyone, but my dilemma does raise a larger issue.  Many here and elsewhere have complained about the recent lack of quality in newly-released books, and I'm sure you all realize this is a side effect of consolidation in the publishing industry. The houses are all run like movie studios now: only 'prestige' titles, blockbusters, and predictably-earning genre fare need apply. This leaves a LOT of great work in the margins, unpublished and unknown to readers, and then the establishment puts the final nail in the coffins of those manuscripts by doing everything in its power to discredit self-publishing.  Authors of self-published books are effectively blackballed from traditional editorial review channels (i.e., Publishers Weekly), yet there are no alternative venues for us to seek editorial reviews. Unfortunately, those reviews provide much-needed jacket copy and still stand as one of the best ways to get the word out about your work.  Given that the Kindle is new, and this group is so enthusiastic about both the Kindle and reading in general, might any of you consider forming an editorial review group specializing in Kindle editions of books, both self-published and traditionally-published? There are some reviewing matters specific to the Kindle (i.e., formatting errors, font that's difficult to read on the screen, etc.), and those factors are never mentioned in 'regular' book reviews. Also, doing Kindle editorial reviews would raise your group's visibility, as your reviews would be posted (and remain) in the Editorial Reviews box on a given book's Amazon product page, and you'd be doing a great service in helping to support the indie author movement. I'd be happy to do any legwork, i.e., try to get ahold of a real person at Amazon to find out how an Editorial Reviewer becomes recognized as such. Thoughts? ",no

The blind hope in Obama-as-messiah is most clearly expressed in the widespread delusion that he would be a president of peace, welcomed by a world eager to bury the warmongering ways of the offices former occupant and renew its respect for America. Columnist Michael Kinsley praised Obamas valuable experience  as what you might call a world manKenyan father, American mother, four formative years living in Indonesia, more years in the ethnic stew of Hawaii, middle name of Hussein, and so onin an increasingly globalized world.

Having never been stirred by the sight of Obama giving an MLK-style speech on the need for change, I can only take the candidates at their words. And Obamas words are ominous indeed. President Obama would be a warmonger. He would be a wide-eyed, zealous interventionist who would not think twice about using Americas military muscle (his words) to overthrow rogue states and to suppress Americas enemies, real and imagined. He would go farther even than President Bush in transforming the globe into Americas backyard and staffing it with spies and soldiers. He would relish the American mission to police the world and topple tyrannical regimes. After eight years of Bushs military meddling in the Middle East, if you want more war, vote Obama.

It is very much a Jewish tale about a failed marriage, its partners unable to overcome their disparate upbringings nor survive the terror of the dissappearances that befell many jewish families living during the Argentine junta of the 1970's. THe husband, Kaddish, is ""un hijo de puta"" shunned by the more respectable jews of Buenos Aires who hire him to deface the gravestones of their scorned ancestors ( apparently during the 1920's there was a thriving jewish trade in prostitution and crime in Buenos Aires). The wife, Lillian, comes from a more respectable jewish family who begged her not to marry Kaddish but his dreams of success and glory won her over;only to result in dissappointment and bitterness when their smart and lovely 19 yr old son is abducted by the dark forces of the junta. They fall into a Kafkaesque spiral, a maze and labyrinth of officials who stonewall their attempts to find their son Pato. This is Englander's second book. His first a short story collection, For The Relief of Unbearable Urges, which was also a treasure of quirky tales all with jewish themes...an orthodox wigmaker, a failed poet caught up in a Stalinesque purge and a gentile who decides to find himself in the jewish religion.

Personally, this is a great opportunity to pick up books that I might otherwise have to pay a good bit more for even on the used book market since I've noticed that the library is often selling books from its shelves that are exactly what I'm interested in - serious military histories and books on international security issues. This time I picked up Walter Russel Mead's Power, Terror, Peace, and War; Graham Allison's Nuclear Terrorism; and David Halberstan's War in a Time of Peace (this last one was a donation and not from the library's own shelves). But the inclusion of these three books on the for sale racks raised the question in my mind - Are Americans losing the interest and/or the ability to deal with books on such weighty topics? If so, is this a function of modern technology, resulting reduced attentions spans? or just a reflection of a modern wartime desire to escape the pressures of such harsh realities via some lighter reading material or other popular entertainments? I've long known that my own reading tastes and habits were far outside the mainstream of our popular culture. Even the mystery novels or westerns I ocassionally read have to have a little thought put into them or they don't hold my interest. Which means that I am not really in a position to answer my own questions as I am myself too far removed from that mainstream to know the answers. Robert A. Mosher",no

Monsoor, United States Navy, distinguished himself through conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Combat Advisor and Automatic Weapons Gunner for Naval Special Warfare Task Group Arabian Peninsula in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom on 29 September 2006. He displayed great personal courage and exceptional bravery while conducting operations in enemy held territory at Ar Ramadi Iraq.  During Operation Kentucky Jumper, a combined Coalition battalion clearance and isolation operation in southern Ar Ramadi, he served as automatic weapons gunner in a combined SEAL and Iraqi Army (IA) sniper overwatch element positioned on a residential rooftop in a violent sector and historical stronghold for insurgents. In the morning, his team observed four enemy fighters armed with AK-47s reconnoitering from roads in the sector to conduct follow-on attacks. SEAL snipers from his roof engaged two of them which resulted in one enemy wounded in action and one enemy killed in action. A mutually supporting SEAL/IA position also killed an enemy fighter during the morning hours. After the engagements, the local populace blocked off the roads in the area with rocks to keep civilians away and to warn insurgents of the presence of his Coalition sniper element. Additionally, a nearby mosque called insurgents to arms to fight Coalition Forces.  In the early afternoon, enemy fighters attacked his position with automatic weapons fire from a moving vehicle. The SEALs fired back and stood their ground. Shortly thereafter, an enemy fighter shot a rocket-propelled grenade at his building. Though well-acquainted with enemy tactics in Ar Ramadi, and keenly aware that the enemy would continue to attack, the SEALs remained on the battlefield in order to carry out the mission of guarding the western flank of the main effort.   Due to expected enemy action, the officer in charge repositioned him with his automatic heavy machine gun in the direction of the enemys most likely avenue of approach. He placed him in a small, confined sniper hide-sight between two SEAL snipers on an outcropping of the roof, which allowed the three SEALs maximum coverage of the area. He was located closest to the egress route out of the sniper hide-sight watching for enemy activity through a tactical periscope over the parapet wall. While vigilantly watching for enemy activity, an enemy fighter hurled a hand grenade onto the roof from an unseen location. The grenade hit him in the chest and bounced onto the deck. He immediately leapt to his feet and yelled grenade to alert his teammates of impending danger, but they could not evacuate the sniper hide-sight in time to escape harm. Without hesitation and showing no regard for his own life, he threw himself onto the grenade, smothering it to protect his teammates who were lying in close proximity. The grenade detonated as he came down on top of it, mortally wounding him.  Petty Officer Monsoors actions could not have been more selfless or clearly intentional. Of the three SEALs on that rooftop corner, he had the only avenue of escape away from the blast, and if he had so chosen, he could have easily escaped. Instead, Monsoor chose to protect his comrades by the sacrifice of his own life. By his courageous and selfless actions, he saved the lives of his two fellow SEALs and he is the most deserving of the special recognition afforded by awarding the Medal of Honor. """,no

If Middlesex could be an Oprah Book Club selection and NYT best seller and actually be GREAT, than maybe there were other best sellers waiting out there for me! And so I decided to pick up The Corrections, recalling that a few years ago it was all the rage, winning awards and topping the NYT list for weeks. I hated it from the first page. The language, the tone, the awful awful characters I had absolutely no sympathy for. As tragedy struck the various family members, all I thought is Good you deserve it. But I couldn't stop reading it, skimming past the verbal diarrhea of Franzen's prose to get to what was actually HAPPENING to them. The one plot line I could not get enough of was that of Alfred, the family patriarch and formerly solid, stalwart man of few words and much anger. Alfred is breaking down, and quickly. As his family careens with disappointment after disappointment, Alfred is quietly losing his mind and control of his bodily functions. The man who had always maintained rigid self control of his body and emotions is falling fast into dementia and adult diapers. The first person view that Franzen paints this picture with was fascinating, all the more poignant because of Alfred's AWARENESS of what was happening to him. The climax comes in the last pages, when Alfred is placed in a hospital for observation, and his beloved middle son visits and cares for him. After a session where he wets himself mid sentence speaking nonsense to his son, Alfred flails in helpless anger, trying to voice his last coherent thoughts, before it's too late. ""I- I have made mistakes- I am alone- I am wet- I want to die- I am sorry- I did my best- I love my children- I need your help- I want to die-"" His son understands his fathers last plea before total mental collapse, but can only say in tears, ""I'm sorry Dad, I can't, I just can't"". And so even the respite of death is denied Alfred. I felt such strong grief for Alfred, I wondered if it made up for the horridness of the rest of the book.

37229,"This thread is now continued by http://www.librarything.com/talktopic.php?topic=37341 I've changed the recommendations page in a number of profound ways. Go to your profile and choose ""Recommendations"" to see it in action, or check out mine here (http://www.librarything.com/profile/timspalding/recommendations). I took the recommendations page down two days ago for a couple reasons. It was complex and fiddly without being as good as it could be. It gave access to personal recommendations based on some of the contributing algorithms, but not to the combined algorithm, which smoothes out many shortcomings. And it was a *bear* on the database, being a consistent drag on performance overall.  The new recommendations page is characterized by: 1. One algorithm based on all five LibraryThing algorithms. 2. Spots for member recommendations and anti- or un-recommendations, both coming. 3. A full 1,000 recommendations, if you have a decent number of books. 4. A good, fastand fully working""Why"" feature. 5. Filtering by other's member's tags, so you get an idea of what's being recommendedwhich is more clear than a filter by what's *recommending,* as beforeand works even if you have no tags of your own. In general, results will vary user-to-user. The overall recommendations can be strongly influenced by one set of books. I haven't provided any filter against same-author recommendations. My hope is that the tag-filtering and large set of recommendations make it possible to zoom in on areas of interest. I'm characterizing this as a ""sneak peak"" because I am uncertain how this will fare under normal load. The new page is easy on the database, but VERY hard on processing power. Once our recommendations are calculated they stick around for 24 hours. But they can take a while to make. (If this feature ends up taking up too much processing power, I'll have to pull it, alas.) For now, recommendations aren't saved over time. In the future I want it to remember what it's recommended, so it can tell you how many recommendations are *new.* Reactions welcome!",no

The pain of waiting years for the last 3 books to be released and in some cases with less than satisfactory results (The One Tree) haunts me to this day. Other series went on and on with no end in sight Xanth and still others kept me on edge worrying that they might never get finished (Dark Tower and Wheel of Time). In the case of Wheel of Time, I stopped reading the series at about book 4 or 5 and decided to wait until Robert Jordan (God rest his soul) finished it. As a result of these experiences, and because there are plenty of other things on my reading list, I would say that I now have a general tendency to wait out authors until they complete a series (or at the very least complete a major story arc) before I read. So here I sit with the first four books of the Song of Ice and Fire series bought and paid for and sitting on my shelf. I wouldn't even ask the question of this group if the series wasn't praised so much, so consistently, and if it wasn't sometimes put on the same level as LOTR. If it was any other series it probably wouldn't even earn my consideration at all, I would simply wait it out. But in this case, based on all of the enthusiasm, I'm not so sure. Do I dare risk going 4 books into a 7 book series where the author takes many years between books? It may take another decade to finish. Is there enough of a payoff with the 4 that already exist? Or should I just move on and savor the whole thing when it ends (my usual preference)?  Or now that I think of it, is it a better use of my time to restart the Wheel of Time series in anticipation of the 12th and final book being published posthumously next year?

I've mentioned Joseph Hone before, several of his books having been released in the Collier Spymasters Series I heard about somewhere. I have what is, I think, the third book featuring his character Peter Marlow: The Flowers of the Forest, released in the US as The Oxford Gambit, is the novel of Hone's that I'm most interested in plot-wise, it being somewhat reminiscent of A Perfect Spy. (This highly detailed discussion of his work implies that each of Hone's four novels featuring Marlow take certain spy fiction tropes, and this one is my ""favorite."") If this wasn't exciting enough for me, I then came across The Soul of Viktor Tronko by David Quammen, which I first heard about here. Quammen is better known as a writer of non-fiction works of natural history, but he did write another spy novel called The Zolta Configuration.

But they are also quite limitedtime and time again DDC splits things into tens that just don't ""fit"" into tens.  All letters: There are more letters, so, in theory, the assignments can be shorter and more space can be ""left blank"" for future expansion. But an all-letters system would look like gibberish, basically. Blended: A blended system is probably necessary if the system is to use any numbers and to sort by main author at some point.

Context in defining historical fiction As far as the reader is concerned, books written in, say, 1920 are basically historical fiction. If Of Mice and Men happened to have been written in 1990 (in the same setting, of course), it would have been classified as historical fiction. OSC should probably recommend a cutoff date for this contextual fiction (something as short as 40 years might be reasonable: WWII fiction is certainly historical fiction). 2. ""Ungenred"" and Romance fiction The lack of subgenres here is due to my own extreme unfamiliarity, not any inherent belief that there are no subgenres.

An employment tribunal upheld her claims that she should not be expected to officiate at any ceremony which is in direct contravention of her Christian beliefs. In the UK civil ceremonies must not include any form of religious blessing, the christian church fought a court battle to make sure that there can be no bible readings or religious hymns in a civil ceremony as it believes these marriages are conducted beyond the reach of Jesus Christ. So are Lillian Ladele's beliefs being compromised if she performs a civil ceremony on any couple, since these services are empty of any form of religious blessing or mention? According to her church, if all civil ceremony marriages are ""beyond the reach of Jesus Christ"" why can she in all good conscience perform a marriage for a heterosexual couple but not a homosexual couple?  Both sides are calling this a political correctness issue, Ladele's supporters saying she has won a victory for common sense above political correctness but her detractors insisting it is a victory for political correctness over common sense.  By the ruling of this tribunal she has effectively won the right to refuse to perform any civil ceremony if she so choses, as she can now decide that they ALL go against her christian beliefs.  http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article3972735.ece ",no

The outer wrap was destroyed in opening, as it was taped all over. The book was one of those tiny hardback books, and the pages were so brown and brittle it simply cannot be read. I have the book, and its sleeve...but it still sort of creeps me out.

The murdering and the violence are self-policing, and can be entrusted to non-professionals. The mass nature of wartime death is useful in many ways. It serves as spectacle, as diversion from the real movements of the War. It provides raw material to be recorded into History, so that children may be taught History as sequences of violence, battle after battle, and be more prepared for the adult world.

Wolfe does something very unprecedented in this story, he stands up to make a point to Cramer. Wow. Archie leaves before it happens again, it is unsettling to him. :) This is a nice little story. Very clever female villain, the clues are there, but so obvious you miss them, at least I missed the most important one, even though I tagged the murderer. Now, how do we feel about the ending? Wolfe provides the means for the criminal to commit suicide. Me, I'm O.K. with it. His reasoning reminds me of conversations I've seen written ""by"" demons (Screwtape Letters, Good Omens), ""We provide the means, they make the choice.""

44884,"I was browsing the web earlier this morning looking for information on Isabel Paterson when I came across this Wikipedia article about Zora Neale Hurston. What caught my attention is that she has been associated with the Old Right, a hodge-podge of anti-New Dealers, comprising such luminaries as H.L. Mencken and Ezra Pound. Here's what Wikipedia says about her politics: Hurston was a Republican who was generally sympathetic to the Old Right and a fan of Booker T. Washington's self-help politics. She disagreed with the philosophies (including Communism and the New Deal) supported by many of her colleagues in the Harlem Renaissance, such as Langston Hughes, who wrote several poems in praise of the Soviet Union. Despite much common ground with the Old Right in domestic and foreign policy, Hurston was not a social conservative. She was essentially a libertarian in philosophy. Her writings show skepticism toward traditional religion and affinity for feminist individualism. In this respect, her views were similar to two libertarian novelists who were her contemporaries, Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson. In 1952, Hurston supported the presidential campaign of Senator Robert A. Taft. Like Taft, Hurston was against the New Deal welfare state. She also shared his opposition to the Roosevelt/Truman interventionist foreign policy. In the original draft of her autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, Hurston compared the U.S. government to a fence in stolen goods and to a Mafia-like protection racket. Hurston thought it ironic that the same people who claim that it is a noble thing to die for freedom and democracy ... wax frothy if anyone points out the inconsistency of their morals. ... We, too, consider machine gun bullets good laxatives for heathens who get constipated with toxic ideas about a country of their own. Roosevelt can call names across an ocean for his four freedoms, but he did not have the courage to speak even softly at home. When Truman dropped the atomic bombs on Japan, she called him the Butcher of Asia. Hurston opposed the Supreme Court ruling in the Brown v. Board of Education case of 1954. She felt that if separate schools were truly equal, and she believed that they were rapidly becoming so, educating black students in physical proximity to white students would not result in better education. In addition, she worried about the demise of black schools and black teachers as a way to pass on cultural tradition to future generations of African-Americans. She voiced this opposition in a letter, ""Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix,"" that was published in the Orlando Sentinel in August 1955. Hurston had not reversed her long-time opposition to segregation. Rather, she feared that the Court's ruling could become a precedent for an all-powerful federal government to undermine individual liberty on a broad range of issues in the future. Fascinating woman, no? The bolded excerpt highlights an aspect about Hurston which I genuinely admire--her cultural conservatism. She seems to have believed that her culture, black culture, was worthy enough to be passed down from generation to generation, and she expressed a sincere worry that Brown v. Board of Education could weaken the ties between blacks and their patrimony. Such a reactionary. So concerned. I love it. Is anyone here familiar with her work? I was thinking about heading to my local used book store tomorrow to see if they had any copies of her book Their Eyes Were Watching God. ",no

I pulled a muscle finding information on him on the web and though his books are readily available from every public domain pirate, I couldn't find a scan of The Masque of the Elements to co-opt and had to make my own. So anyway, Scheffauer: Herman Scheffauer was an American poet, born in San Francisco in 1878 (the same year David Park Barnitz dropped into Wheeling). He was a member of what I will call the SF group of decadent poets: W. C. Morrow, George Sterling, etc., all under the aegis of Ambrose Bierce (excepting Morrow, whose talents Bierce questioned in print).  He wrote a few books of langourous/cosmogonic poetry, and shared in the antics of Sterling and his Bohemian Grove buddies until 1910 when the Fatherland called to him and, eluding English dragnets, popped off to Berlin. There he wrote urbanely partisan articles until 1927 at which point he freaked out, killed a woman and himself (extravagantly). H. L. Mencken (another protege of Bierce's - and of James Gibbons Huneker): ""in 1926 he began to show signs of mental aberration, and in 1927 he committed suicide in Berlin. He took himself off in a really gaudy manner, first cutting the throat of his woman secretary and then jumping out of a window."" Maybe something he picked up at the Grove?

A couple of weeks ago, I got the chance to read a novel I had long wanted to get my hands on: Knut Hamsun's Growth of the Soil. I was happy to find a new Penguin edition which flaunted its ""new Sverre Lyngstad translation"" on the cover. Even without that, the translation immediately called attention to itself - by the first page in fact. I have no idea how Knut Hamsun writes, but the prose is this particular edition is stilted, contorted and, to judge by the large number of awkward, non-English constructions, would seem to be written by less than proficient English speaker. Regardless of this, I thoroughly enjoyed the book (and heartily recommend it), but I was left with the feeling that either the work had shone DESPITE the translation, or that Hamsun had a great imagination but was a clumsy and laborious writer (unlikely in a Nobel Prize winner, I would have thought). Perhaps my impression is wrong - maybe Hamsun really did write in this odd style. Maybe he had a particular reason - e.g. to convey the language of the people he writes about...? Would a native Norwegian be able to let me know? This is not an academic question: I am curious because I intend to read more of Hamsun but, for the moment, probably in earlier translations.",no
45351,"I'm planning to start a reread of the series soon, when I should be caught up on my requests from the library that are in and still have a few weeks until when the next new books I am looking forward to reading are published. I'm not really interested in a ""group read"" as such: I'd hate having to hold myself back to just a few chapters a day, mostly. However, I was thinking of posting discussion threads for each book as I go, so that whenever one of us reads one, our comments will have somewhere to go. (Something like the Jim Butcher group has.) The catch is that while people reading The Dresden Files, or at least those who bother hanging around an LT group devoted to the author, will probably be reading through the whole series, even fans of The Scarlet Pimpernel are far more likely to read The Scarlet Pimpernel itself than the rest of the books (partly because of the rest being harder to find). Do you think it is appropriate to have just one thread for the book in the series that is most likely to generate discussion? Or would it be more appropriate to create threads for smaller subjects within the original book as needed?",no

4542,"Sally Melville is writing a series of knitting books with cumbersome titles. They are The Knitting Experience: Inspiration & Instruction (Book 1: The Knit Stitch), The Knitting Experience: Inspiration & Instruction (Book 2: The Purl Stitch), and The Knitting Experience: Inspiration & Instruction (Book 3: Color). Go to combine her works, and you see there are main entries for each individual volume, plus the series itself (The Knitting Experience: Inspiration & Instruction). Some people have combined Book 1 with the series. What's the general practice here? Book 1 is indeed part of the KE series, so it doesn't exactly feel wrong to combine the two - but then Books 2 and 3 should also be combined into the series. Yet the way I understand combining, Books 1, 2, and 3 shouldn't be combined together, since they're not the same work, not in the sense that various translations of the Odyssey can be thought of as being the same work. Yet the main series title is what the Library of Congress thinks of this as, as though each book is just a chapter in a larger work.

Brendan and Sherilyn Gutteridge seem happier than ever before but neighbours concerns are raised when they realise they haven't seen their small daughter Samantha for quite a long time. Social services are called but find nothing wrong but then the Gutteridges go on holiday and a shocking secret is revealled to the community. It's told in personal accounds by neighbours, social workers, police officers, family members and Brendan and Sherilyn themselves and each chapter reveals more and more shocking clues and facts about the couple and their child. I think the book is designed to make each reader feel uncomfortable and wonder about what goes on behind closed doors in their own street and how much responsibility they might have to shoulder should something like this be taking place.

47191,"So. The facts: 1) A friend is selling her bookstore. (She recently got engaged and will be moving to the US.) I've always wanted to have a bookstore/coffeeshop. 2) It's located in Boquete. I've always wanted to live in Boquete  it's a charming little mountain town, six or so hours from here (Panama City) by land (5 hours if by express bus), where I have family, and it's a cozy place, cool weather... And my family owns coffee plantations (but we're not millionaires or anything!) there, so I've always thought that'd be a cool thing to do: have a coffeeshop where I could sell the family's coffee!! We don't have a brand name or anything, we don't even own a hmmm... a coffee roasting contraption device thingie (the word's torrefactora in Spanish, but I don't know if there's an exact term in English for that.) So we just sell untoasted coffee beans to other companies. I've always wanted to do something about that. 3) Since I'm officially a freelancer now, I can do my translation work from anywhere in this planet. I only need a) a laptop and b) a fairly decent Internet connection, plus c) a means to get paid by bank transfer, no problem. So I could still technically continue to do translation work in the evenings, which is what I'm doing now anyway, and tend to the bookstore during the day. 4) Two friends of mine are interested in becoming my partners in this. We have very similar mindsets and I think we'll get along in this. Now, my fears/worries, etc... 1) The money issue. If we do split this evenly between the three of us, it won't amount to more than $8,000 or so each. Which is not toooo much, but it's $8,000 I don't have and I'll have to borrow from someone/somewhere. 2) The move all the way up there. Leaving my family here (cutting the umbilical cord, so to speak! heh), taking a huge leap! Getting a place to live over there, selling a bunch of stuff that I have over here which would be complicated to keep and so on. Transportation (my car is not currently in shape for travelling all the way over there.) 3) What if it doesn't work? I have absolutely no head for business. :( I know I can learn. Trial and error. But still, I'm terrified! 4) Will I be able to balance both my translation business AND the bookstore business? 5) Friends are one thing, but business partners are another. What if something goes wrong? I certainly don't want to ruin my friendship with these guys over a business deal gone sour. :S On one hand, I'm very, very excited. It's something that I've always wanted to do, but never had more than the idea of it. Never made actual plans, and now plop! the offer just fell onto my lap, so to speak. On the other hand... I have five fingers. Errr... I mean, I'm scared! :S For now, the three of us are planning on a trip over there next weekend, to see the place (we've only seen pictures so far), get a feel of the business, that kind of thing.

47349,"I've noticed there are at least several of us who read e-books, so I thought it might be fun to start a thread for e-book advice and news, and to provide help for anyone wanting to get started. We could also call out any new etailers carrying romances as we find them.  I've been reading e-books for about three years. I started with a PDA, and this year added a mini-laptop that I got to travel with and discovered it makes a great ebook reader. It has a 7-inch screen, and I can rotate the screen, flip the laptop on its side, and hold it like a hardback book. I've got more than 600 e-books now, and I use the Mobipocket software, having switched from MS Reader because Mobipocket has better library management capabilities.  I've been watching the Amazon Kindle with interest, but I don't want a single-purpose device -- too much to carry when traveling -- and I'm afraid I don't trust any retailer enough to get locked in to a single provider. I use Fictionwise for almost all my purposes, though I've bought occasionally from Ellora's Cave and eHarlequin.

I have some vision issues, so love being able to increase the font as much as I want, and I love having all those books on one little memory card.

49372,"In 1821 Thomas de Quincey published the first edition of his now famous Confessions of an English Opium Eater chronicling his experiences with the drug. These included his dreams and the original manuscript was written in haste at one might say a 'fever pitch'. The final section, ""The Pains of Opium"", recounts the extreme of the author's opium experience (up to that time), with insomnia, nightmares, frightening visions, and difficult physical symptoms. Thomas de Quincey revised his 'Confessions' for a new edition in 1856 and it is this edition that we enjoy today. All this is in preface to a brief discussion of Charles Dickens and opium. Dickens' biographer Peter Ackroyd notes a slight connection between de Quincey and Dickens' family during their move early in Charles' life to the city (Dickens by Peter Ackroyd, p. 19). It does not seem to be a stretch to imagine that the mature Dickens was aware of, if not familiar with, de Quincey's work. It with this in mind that we turn to the opening scene of The Mystery of Edwin Drood which is set in an opium den. It is the aura of this den and the degenerates within that create the first hint of mysteriousness that will be with the reader throughout the, unfortunately, uncompleted work. A brief passage follows: ""Shaking from head to foor, the man whose scattered consciousness has thus fantastically pieced itself together, at length rises, supports his trembling frame upon his arms, and looks around. He is in the meanest and closest of small rooms. Through the ragged window-curtain, the light of early day steals in from a miserable court.""(p. 7) The man is John Jasper who, in a Jekyll and Hyde fashion, will inhabit the book and find the aura of the opium den is not the only part of his aspect that suggests villainy. One mystery in the story is that no proof is ever presented of any overt malediction on his part; therefore we must simply rely on his creepily obsessive behavior enhanced by the aura of the opium den to feed our speculations. At the end of the manuscript we have only journeyed halfway into the story; thus the ends are left loose and destined to lay before us like unanswered questions for eternity.",no

I mean, the Foundation books just don't stack up all that well against more modern novels. - the poll was clearly dominated by US voters. Ender's Game, while not unknown, doesn't have the prestige in the UK that it does in the US - most likely because it's never been studied in British schools (and so it bloody well shouldn't be). I should point out that New Scientist is a UK magazine. - the Star Wars fanboys didn't get a look-in - because the NS staff decided not to lump the votes for individual Star Wars films together. Smart move on their part. - Serenity is probably the most popular not-stupid sf film of the 21st century - and not-stupid is a sadly small subset of all sf films released since 2000 - so I suppose its appearance on the list shouldn't come as a surprise. - but Forbidden Planet's does. Good film - amazing, even, for its time. But I'm surprised it was that popular. There must have been a large bloc of older voters... - what? No Alien?",no
49661,"I wonder if anybody can recommend a book which needs to fit quite tight description. I have to analyse a literary text (or several texts) for an essay. Initially, I thought about comparing some of the novels of the Bront sisters with each other, especially Wuthering Heights and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, both of which I love and show several similarities (issues of gender, etc.). However, I am now thinking that if I want to write about questions of sex and gender, it might be more to the point to compare one of these two books to another one of a British male author from the same period, which might yield some more interesting contrasts. Of course, a novel dealing with a similar topic would be great. Any suggestions, anyone? Cheers, rfb.",yes

Basically he believes in the notion of agency, which for him means the universe HAS meaning. Now he is not advocating a personal God, but he does believe in a God tied to nature.  I find this interesting because one of the beliefs I hold is that if the universe is meaningless, then we really have no obligation to ""save the planet,"" since there is no meaning in saving or not saving existence as we know it.  But Kauffman posits that the universe does have meaning, which would mean we do have certain obligations.  So I found this to be a pretty challenging article.",no

They told stories in which the reader was cast as protagonist (though there was no 'fighting fantasy' choice element as in ""turn to page 10 to go North, turn to page 11 to go South"""". Each page featured some sort of puzzle(s) and there were common puzzle themes running through the book. Often some sort of problem / cliffhanger would arise and there would be a question about how the character was going to proceed and overcome the problem. When you turned the page you'd find out whether you had guessed the right solution. One I recall as being about a run-down burlesque funfair, and some sort of evil plot involving poison gas hidden in light bulbs (one of the puzzles running through that book involved spotting the bulbs which contained the gas). The other book, in the same series, had a fantasy setting and the only puzzle I remember involved a question of where a character could hide having escaped from a castle into the surrounding moat, the answer being that he should use some reeds to form a snorkel to breathe through.

I tell myself that I have a fairly large range of interest in books, but looking over what I've read this year I expect this to be a large list of horror and sci-fi with a healthy slab of cheese (movie novelizations and 'tie-in' books to other media) and a smattering non-fiction and 'quality' fiction. I'm part of a Stephen King reading group. We're reading his books in the order of publication, one a month, so he ought to be well represented here. I never know what my next book will be until I'm about fifty pages from the end of my current book, but in 2009 my goal is to read The Mutiny on the Bounty, Monster Nation and Monster Planet (I didn't really like the first book in the trilogy, but since I've bought the rest I'm gonna power through), Peyton Place, Logan's Run, The Bookseller of Kabul, The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril, Into Hot Air and whatever else on my TBR pile catches my eye.",no

The emphasis in nonfiction is on primary sources. 2008/01/10 I'm reading Walking with the Wind by John Lewis. It's so great to hear his voice and his direct feeling about non-violence. Also great to read for its spirituality as well as the history. I read The Children by David Halberstam, which is great. The Children is more polished writing, but I am enjoying Walking with the Wind as much or more. I also read some of Taylor Branch, which is more comprehensive. Adding: Reviewing U.S. and New York State History by Elaine Farran and Ann-Jean Paci. It's a middle school text, but comprehensive and to the point. It will cover some areas that I forgot. I tried to read English Patient. I quit half way through. The only character I could not stand was the English Patient himself. I found his characterization melodramatic and sensationalist -- way over the top without reason. I read Gilead, which is fantastic. I'm including Home in my new Kindle book purchases.

53994,"1. The Mother Tongue: English & How It Got That Way - Bill Bryson. Recommended, especially since the author's humorous inclinations prevail. The original Indo-European languages split into a dozen broad groups. English is part of the Germanic family, which gradually split into three branches: North Germanic, West Germanic, and East Germanic. English belongs to the West Germanic group. In Japanese, the word for foreigner means ""stinking of foreign hair"". Germans call cockroaches ""Frenchmen"". The French call lice ""Spaniards"". The Romance languages are derived from the Latin vulgate (common speech).  The main bringer to Britain of literacy, and Christianity, was St. Augustine, who traveled there with forty missionaries in 597. The English language has changed dramatically over the centuries. It was considerably influenced by Viking raiders and, later, by the Norman conquest of 1066. During this latter time, dialects prospered and multiplied. We have some forty sounds in English, but more than 200 ways of spelling them (e.g., the ""sh"" sound - sugar, passion, ambitious, ocean, champagne).  English is full of boobytraps for the unwary foreigner. However, it is one of the world's great growth industries. There are now far more students of English in China than there are people in the United States. However, in the United States, approximately one in five people don't speak English in the home.",no

5501,"The earliest mention Fogies can find of the hosonagai shimaguni ""long narrow island country"" as Japan is called is a few casual references in texts from the Han dynasty, mere notes of its existence. Two or three centuries later we find sufficiently detailed description to allow the inference that travelers from Japan had reached China. By the Tang dynasty there was a regular traffic of pilgrims from Japan to Buddhist temples in China. The Japanese language is totally different from Chinese; morphology, syntax, vocabulary are all entirely unrelated. But when the Japanese set out to write their own language, the Chinese script was the only model they had. (Think how different the history of east Asia would be if the Japanese had encountered the Indic alphabets much earlier than they did.) For centuries the cultural flow, and the linguistic flow, was all in one direction, with students from Japan coming to China, learning Chinese (more or less) and taking Chinese vocabulary back with them to enrich their native language. Japanese now contains tens of thousands of Chinese loanwords. Nothing people do remains unelaborated. Noting that in Chinese, just as in their own language, compound words could be created by combining simple ones, the Japanese began to create compound words in what is now called Sino-Japanese. An example is dooshi  ""comrades, fellows, colleagues."" It can be found as an ad hoc compound in an early Chinese text, but it was in Japan that it became a word. When in the 19th C some Chinese became aware that, like it or not, they would have to make some adaptation to western ways, many went as students to Europe and America, but many more found it less of a journey and less of a culture shock to study in Japan. There they encountered and brought back to China these made-in-Japan Sino-Japanese words, including even a few that were purely Japanese with no Chinese source, such as  changhe, the Chinese pronunciation of the Japanese kanji for the Japanese word baai ""circumstances.""

I don't really stick very long to genera and I think it will be good for me to spread out my 50 as best I can. I'd like to do a little laughing, a little thinking (only a little, mind), and a little learning while I read. But enough blather! Time to get into it. Wish me luck! Counting from January 1st (who doesn't like a nice, square number?), I've started out the year with Ender's Game, possibly a reread, but it's been so long since I may or may not have originally read it that even if I have, I think I can by now count it has having become unread. I liked it. Card's writing is very accessible and the story is always moving around. I also think the story does a good job of setting itself up for the ending (which, unfortunately, I was aware of while I was reading). I did think, however, that the whole plot back on Earth was kind of oddly incomplete and the very end of the book (after the war) seemed sort of hastily done, as though Card had tired of the book and just sort of needed a way to wrap everything up. After my Sci-fi lead, I switched gears settled in for a little introspection, guided by Monty Python and Philosophy. This is, not surprisingly, a collection of essays that deal in one way or another with either philosophy as it applies to Monty Python, or Monty Python as it applies to philosophy. Despite most of the book being pretty academic, it was a good read. There were plenty of python sketches reproduced to keep me giggling, and I even learned a thing or two about philosophy. Certainly not a must-read, but it kept me entertained and clarified some of the broader ideas within philosophy about which I am (was!) totally ignorant. As an aside, I understand that probably everyone who frequents a site like this has no need for more books to pile on top of their TBR stacks...HOWEVER.

56623,"I'm going to give it another shot this year! At least I'm starting the count in January and not August--like last year.  # 1 Twilight-- After much encouragement from my students, I finally read it. I thought it was repetitive, but I could clearly see its mass appeal, who wouldn't want the love and attention of a dangerous and perfect (just how may times did Myers tell us how perfect he is?) vampire? The female attraction to the ""bad boy"" archetype is clearly evident-- do you think if this were done in the early 1950's James Dean would play Edward? 01/09 #2 Gilead -- As beautifully written as Housekeeping, Robinson confirms her brilliance with this book. I may have read this somewhere and am merely just repeating it, but she writes a silence into prose that is usually reserved for the poet. I particularly enjoyed Ames' musings on the everyday happenings around him as much as if not more than his retelling of his family history or revealing the secrets of Jack Boughton.  #3 Death with Interruptions 1/09 A witty parable that had me laughing out loud at times as well as ready to toss it against the wall in frustration as it captures the ridiculousness of talk media culture and the abuses of capitalism. Preposterous enough, death takes holiday in a nameless country ( all of Saramagos settings are nameless) and the first part of the novel is a scramble to figure out what should be done with those who cannot die as it affects insurance corporations, nursing homes, hospitals, and funeral homes, etc. In fact, in order to keep their business lucrative funeral homes make an appeal to the government to require all pet owners have funeral services for their pets, no more backyard burials. Insurance Companies request that the government pass a law so that everyone (even though they are not dead) must be legally considered dead at 80, so as not to provide an eternity of benefits. The parallels between Saramagos world and our culture are purposefully obvious. He captures the ridiculousness of media, the greed and corruption of big business, and the hierarchies of power who see the event as a monetary opportunity so well that I felt frustrated and disgusted. Hence, I wanted to throw the book against the wall as I recognized my own impotence and participation in such a culture. When death as character appears, a beautiful 36 year old woman, she resumes killing, and it is never revealed why she stopped putting an end to life. However, in her return to duty, she does change her method. She sends letters informing each victim that he or she will die in one week, and humans become predictable with such information. When one letter is returned to her multiple times, death goes on adventure to find this person who has eluded death, and I enjoyed this part of the novel the most. #4 Twigs and Knucklebones by Sarah Lindsay 1/09 Lindsay's poetry impresses with its ability to make metaphor out scientific discovery. Her fascination with the past and ability to create a poignancy and resonance with the present make her one of the best poets I've read in a long while.",no

58278,"Donald Evans, 1884-1921, was an American decadent/bohemian poet, born in Philadelphia, PA and associated with the Greenwich Village artists of the turn of the century (as was another another ill-fated poet, done to death in the Bronx, Maxwell Bodenheim, who was also connected with Ben Hecht and the ""Chicago Renaissance""). He was greatly admired by the young Wallace Stevens. Evans enlisted in the army in 1917 and served in Europe during the war.  Evans collections of poetry include Sonnets from the Patagonian, Discords, Two Deaths in the Bronx and Nine Poems From a Valetudinarium. Evans is included in the Edward Foster anthology, Decadents, Symbolists a Aesthetes in America: Fin-de-Siecle American Poetry as well as in one of my favorite anthologies, T. R. Smith's Poetica Erotica. Evans vision seems to have been equally voluptuous and mortuary. I have just begun to collect his poetry. After I have read it, I will comment on it and on Evans; I will also post what I take to be a rare photograph of the author (rare in that I have had no luck finding anything on the web).  Here are a few examples of the poetry: SONNET ETERNAL   IT is not that I love thee any less,  Which holds me back when I might so close be:  Thy lips have opened, calling hungrily,  And thy eyes fill with questioning distress.  I stand away but to once more confess  How my whole soul throbs with its pride in thee,--  Still gaze I at my fortune wonderingly,  For thou art near the stars in perfectness!    O keen clean limbs! O little sweet fleet feet!  O bright white thighs that are love's resting-place!  O singing curves that make thy body's line!  When and where was it first we two did meet?    And how have I deserved of life this grace,  Possession of thy womanhood divine?  DINNER AT THE HOTEL DE LA TIGRESSE VERTE 1-Terrace As they sat sipping their glasses in the courtyard Of the Hotel de la Tigresse Verte, With their silk-swathed ankles softly kissing, They were certain that they had forever Imprisioned fickleness in the vodka They knew they had found the ultimate pulse of love. Story upon story, the dark windows whispered down To them from above, and over the roof's edge Danced a grey moon. The woman pressed her chicken-skin fan against her breast And through her ran trepidant mutinies of desire With treacheries of emotion. Her voice vapoured: ""In which room shall it be to-night, darling?"" His eyes swept the broad facade, the windows, Tier upon tier, and his lips were regnant: ""In every room, my beloved!"" 2-Loyalty I am kissing your wayward feet The rumours of flight are broken, Your hands are a dear pale token. I adore you to touch me, sweet, And now are the frail vows spoken. It is bravely the words are said, Faith is a flash on our faces We mock as the mummer traces The dawn when the month is dead, Loyalty mussed like your laces. AS A DECADENT PASSES Bid the dawn come; the moonlight is too pale; 	Shadows are tiring me; night is so long. Shabby are the lures of life, and they all fail,  	Nor is there music for the farewell song. Death has prepared a most authentic thrill   	I hear the whisper of his winding sheet, And, lo! He brings me over the lone hill 	New cut gardenias for my head and feet. INFIDELITIES My darling, you write me charming letters from your bed,  They caress me, and the darkness covers us,  And your luminous whispers are in my ear,  You call me, and I come to you as I read,  Eager to give you my hands,  And be lost upon your breast.  But often next day when I re-read a letter I dream,  I wonder, was not your husband, while you wrote it  In the next room rising from his bath,  And sprinkling rice powder over himself  Making ready to come to you?  Were not perhaps the words you wrote  Your torch to set yourself in flames?  Did not the last Echoes  Of your call to your lover  Help to sweep you not too passively  To accustomed clamorous arms?

If fiction serves to help us understand each other, this novel helped me to understand what drives someone to stowaway on a tanker to come to America illegally and what awaits him when he arrives - and this community that is nearly invisible to me.

I've been advised to get translations of English novels I already know fit what I'm looking for, but I get so bored reading translations of things I've already read! So, could I get some suggestions, please? I'm not looking for anything terribly ""literary,"" since I don't have any trouble finding those on my own. I prefer comedy and satire to serious stuff usually, and I like historical fiction and light fantasy and most YA.  I've tried poking around at different book-seller sites, but I've never really enjoyed looking for books on them, and it's more annoying when I'm not completely familiar with all the terms. I mean, part of my goal in getting more books (or e-books) in French is to improve my vocabulary and keep my reading comprehension from deteriorating now that I've graduated from university and no longer have French class to force me to practice.

61105,"I guess that some of you have been following my comments about wanting to Boycott Anne Rice over in the Anne Rice Fans Group. Well, What Ifer's I wanted to pose a hypothetical situation to everyone here. What If.... Anne Rice had originally started out writing her Christian Novels instead of Horror Novels and it was the Christian Novels that had made her famous and a household name then she decides that she will never write another Christian Novel again. And dedicate the rest of her life to only writing Horror Novels. Here's the hypotheitical situation I'm talking about. Don't you all think that people would have a right to be Pissed Off and upset and want to Boycott her books because she chose to disregard the genre that made her a household name and famous Author in the first place? Wouldn't people feel that she owes it to her original fan base to continue writing the genre that made her famous in the first place? Why couldn't she try to appease both fans bases by saying she would continue writing her Christian Novels and Horror Novels too? She is only trying to appeal to her new fan base which I feel isn't right. The What If.... group here is a wonderful smart bunch of people and I await your responses to my hypothetical case I just presented to everyone.

62115,"First I found 'SPYCATCHER' BY Peter Wright which was about the Soviet Moles in the British Domestic counter-intelligence dept. MI5 and the others in the British Foreign Intelligence dept. MI6 and the Foreign Office (State Dept.). This was very good and I recommend it.  Now I have ''SECRET WARS, One Hundred Years of British Intelligence inside MI5 and MI6' by Gordon Thomas. This work is quite good at avoiding discussing, or even naming, the Soviet Moles who reached the highest levels of management in these organizations. Unfortunately this book reveals that the Ox-Bridge 'Old Buoy' network is still working to try to maintain their former prestige by referring to the man who suspected, and exposed, the 'Old Buoys' as being Soviet agents as a 'renegade'. He certainly was not, but his efforts to expose the upper-claass traitors were a threat to the prestige of the Ox-Bridgers and their pretensions to innate superiority and preferment. One American Intelligence officer summed it up by concluding that the need to maintain confidence in the Ox-Bridge 'Buoys' was leading them to prefer loss of National Security secrets rather than reveal that 'their kind of people' were actually traitors. One of the most revealing facts was that all directors of British Intelligence Services up until the end of the twentieth century matriculated at Oxford or Cambridge Universities during the 1930's, when Socialism and Communism were intellectually fashionable. By the end of this period the directors were in their 70's and 80's. Most of the traitors were homosexuals, for some reason. But this makes the story only more Juicy.  The next book in this series will be 'Piercing the Reich' by Joseph E. Persico, which is the story of the infant American Intelligence organizations penetrating Nazi Germany during World War II.

That decades and centuries in European history are often condensed to tell a story while American history is often chunked into decade or even 4 or 8 year spans and there are many stories that focus on a single year, and so there are many more chunks to American history.  Perhaps this is a bit reductionist, but can American history be condensed into one story? Spanning from the exploration of North America by Europeans to today, is there one theme that weaves together all of American history? If so, what is it? How does it weave through all the different pieces that we normally break American history into in order to deal with things in some semblance of chronology?",no

Ellen's father insists that she quit her job and return home to become a caregiver. A high-powered career woman, Ellen has never felt she had much in common with her mother, a homemaker and the heart of the family. Yet as Ellen begins to spend time with Kate, she discovers many surprising truths, not only about herself, but also about a woman she thought she knew so well. Later, when Ellen is accused of the mercy killing of her mother, she must not only defend her own life but make a difficlt choice--either accept responsiblity for an act she did not commit or divulge the name of the person she belives committed a painful act of love.

64495,"This is my first book received as part of the Library Thing Member Giveaway programme, and I did not want to post anything until I have considered what should be written. I have mixed feelings about this book, after taking quite some time to read it properly. First of all, I will not say anything about the various formating mistakes, since I assume the author will have taken steps to ensure that a qualified editor processes it before publication. This is, after all, an ARC (Advance Reader Copy). Also, I do not wish to give spoilers about the plot, just pointers that may help readers make up their own mind. Now, the story of a dog, Jack, with miraculous/divine powers intrigued me enough that it kept me reading just to know what happens. There is some suspens and cliffhangers that are well placed within the book, and I was interested in how the story was developing. The characterization (including the dogs') was extremely well developed to start with, and the multiple narrative voices gave an interesting twist to the story. The reader's focalization is based (but also limited) to the characters' own experience. However, there are some perceptions in reading the book that puzzled me - the strong 'religious' undertone makes that characters do not question any of the fantastic events that take place before them, and this is deeply unsettling, since great pain was taken in characterization, just to end up with two-dimensional quasi-automated humans. Only the dog, as a central character, is able to have more depth in his role, others are just tools for his mission. Also, through detailled characterization, there was too much importance given to the past of the characters, used as an excuse to explain their presence in the plot. I could have done without reading the stereotypical Irish picture, in the character of Clancy, it is detrimental and does not serve any purpose. With multiple narrative voices in a linear chronology, the multiple 'past' lives experiences and explanations are confusing at best. Otherwise, the plot is fine, although very religious, and could have been handled with more depth regarding the humans. In the end, the book does not read so well, because it seems to digress in multiple directions and explanations. Maybe it should have been kept to the human point of views, or to try something similar to Animal Farm, with animals only as 'humanized' characters. All in all, this is a deeply unsettling book, so potential readers may well decide to have a go at reading it or not, but it reads like a draft, rather than a fully edited novel.

65963,"At the beginning of the 12th century, Englands king is Henry I, who also rules Normandy, a large part of what is now northern France. (The kingdom of France itself was then a comparatively smaller area centered around Paris.)  1135 AD Henry I dies, leaving the throne to his only legitimate heir, his daughter Matilda. Since neither England nor Normandy has ever been ruled by a woman, Matilda is challenged by her cousin Stephen, who is crowned king.  AD 1137 In Paris, 15-year-old Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine, makes an arranged marriage with the pious King Louis of France and causes scandal by accompanying him on crusade with Amazon ladies-in-waiting. AD 1138 Matilda declares war on Stephen in a bid to reclaim her birthright. Her husband, Geoffrey Plantagenet, fights to win back Normandy for Matilda. In England, the civil war between Matilda and Stephen lasts nearly 15 years. Towards the end of the war, Matildas armies are led by her son, Henry Plantagenet, a young, brilliant, and crafty fighter. AD 1152 Henry Plantagenet marries Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine, only months after she receives her divorce from Louis of France. Henry is eleven years younger than Eleanor. AD 1154 At the age of 21, Henry becomes the undisputed King of England, and restores peace and prosperity to a ruined country. He now rules an empire stretching from the borders of Scotland to the Pyrenees. AD 1162 Henry II creates his close friend Thomas  Becket Archbishop of Canterbury. A big mistake because AD 1166 Archbishop Thomas opposes Henrys legal reforms, including Henrys move to punish criminal clerics in civil courts. Previously, only the Church could try priests, often dismissing the charges and leaving them to offend again. AD 1170 In Normandy an infuriated Henry II calls for the death of Archbishop Thomas. Some of his knights, with their own grievance against Becket, murder the archbishop in Canterbury Cathedral. AD 1173 In a grab for power, Eleanor encourages her and Henrys older sons in rebellion against him. When the rebellion fails, she is put under house arrest and banished to a castle on the Welsh border, only allowed out occasionally for Christmas. Archbishop Thomas is made a saint. In the Middle East, after nearly a hundred years of Crusades, Saladin becomes sultan of Egypt. AD 1182 Jews are banished from the Kingdom of France. Henry protects the Jews in his lands, both in England and on the continent. AD 1185 Henry frees Eleanor from house arrest. She nevertheless sides with their elder surviving son, Richard Coeur-de-Lion, against him. AD 1189 Henry, learning that his youngest son, John, has joined Richard in the war against him, dies broken in heart and body. King Richard I is more interested in crusade than in his kingdom. His coronation paves the way for the first serious assault on English Jews. Thanks to his father, Henry, though, he now rules an England bound by Common Law and the jury system, the most advanced justice system of its day.",no

67629,"A.K.A., why I love Economics. http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf ABSTRACT We review literatures on agreeing to disagree and on the rationality of differing priors, in order to evaluate the honesty of typical disagreements. A robust result is that honest truth-seeking agents with common priors should not knowingly disagree. Typical disagreement seems explainable by a combination of random belief influences and by priors that tell each person that he reasons better than others. When criticizing others, however, people seem to uphold rationality standards that disapprove of such self-favoring priors. This suggests that typical disagreements are dishonest. We conclude by briefly considering how one might try to become more honest when disagreeing. The basic idea seems to be this. Suppose that, say, Gene and I are both honest truth seekers who are rational, and each of us knows the other is a rational truth seeker. Then if Gene and I disagree, it must be because we have different information. Given that, we will simply tell each other what the other doesn't know, and once we have the same information we'll (since we're both rational) draw the same conclusions.",no
67660,"I know that for the majority who participate in this group, morality was revealed to Moses from God on Mt Sinai in 1440 BC, but this question is posed to the small minority of this group who are not fully convinced of that.* Is there a morality that can be established firmly by study and analysis and fact? At a recent congressional hearing on new financial regulation, a well informed and knowledgable Congressman asked the representative from the Federal Reserve if capitalism is the same as survival of the fittest. I thought the question spoke well of the Congressman's understanding of evolution and of economics, areas in which I have demonstrated my deficiencies right here on HH. The representative from the Federal Reserve was silent on the question, obviously less informed on matters of evolution and economics.* The context of the questioning seemed to me was a perspective that capitalism and survival of the fittest might be morally wrong. Recently on HH a comment was made to the point that the prospect of reward might make an action less moral than that same action without the prospect of a reward. Morality varies culturally and is often conditional to circumstances. In my mind morality must be tied less to motive and more to consequences, but that is only my thought.  Is it possible to study historical and present moralities and to discover a ground for establishing morality, a moral code based on science and fact? My limited reading of Nietsche leads me to think he tried something like that approach. Though not sure I like his conclusions, I do like what I know of his questions. Is it possible to start with basic questions, as I understand did Nietsche, not assuming an existing morality and seeking its justification, and to use scientific approaches to discover a true moral ground? This question may be more suitable for another group. I apologize if that is the case, and will withdraw the question. Not trying to discuss morality, only to ask if there is the possibility for a scientific basis for morality? Perhaps also, if yes, then which sciences might have an input?

67760,"Firstly, I think I love this group already. Secondly, I read children's books for fun. And I'm not ashamed of it. I am only a teenager, admittedly, but I am willing to read anything and everything. However, I always find myself going back to the Ages 6-12 section of bookstores. Why? Well... They're happy books. Usually, anyway. I enjoy reading sad stuff as much as the next person. I'll willingly flick through writings on any subject from acral necrosis to the Holocaust; from rape and pillage to famine and flood. But at the same time, I yearn for happy endings, which means that I am sometimes shunned by ""serious"" readers. Children's books are full of happy things; more so than most romance novels, I find. They may or may not be about serious matters, although sad kids' books are generally in the 'Young Adult' section, even if the main characters are children. Even so, they generally have happy endings and plenty of humour, even if the jokes are sometimes limited to the scatological. I also think that some children's books are better written than many adult's books. Perhaps editors are more worried about kids reading Something They Oughtn't, so the manuscripts are looked over more carefully. I wouldn't know. But I do know that there are far less clumsy similes and painfully overdone descriptions in children's books than in at least some of the 'adult' books I've read. Plenty of people my age read 'grown-up', solemn books - or pretend to - and insist on showing off about them.

Notice the source and reviewer are listed and link back to the original online review (if available). Also notice the thumbs up/down/mixed. That signifies the overall tone of the review.  Once reviews have been entered a work will gain a thingScore. The thingScore shows the general attitude toward the book over all reviews. So, all things being equal, a book with a thingScore of 80 was better received by the reviewers than one that has a thingScore of 10.  This is what you see when editing a review.

I keep looking at the nice looking trio of Darwin books and think, ""who reads that?"" While I enjoy the occasional scientific article, I feel like picking up Darwin would be an incredibly tedious experience. How can it be anything other than ponderous and dull? Clearly, Folio wouldn't have bothered publishing these (and using them as an introductory offer) if they weren't popular. But to me, they seem like shelf weights. Do people curl up with Darwin at the end of a long day? Or do the books just look nice and collect dust? Are the only people who actually read Darwin scientists? So, feel free to convince me I'm right or wrong, terrifically misinformed or pretty much spot on, despite my ignorance.

Charing Cross Road is an epistolary book chronicling her correspondence with a British book dealer in the 50's and 60's, and its definitely a laugh out loud book. The best way I can describe her sense of humor is to say its a bit like Lewis Black, which is oddly appropriate, as she's jewish (not that I'm saying all jews are like that.) At one point she requests a copy of the Latin Vulgate, and when she gets it responds ""WHAT KIND OF A BLACK PROTESTANT BIBLE IS THIS?"" After a paragraph disparaging the church of england for ""tinkering with the vulgate latin"" asserting in no uncertain terms that they'll burn for it, she goes on to say ""Its nothing to me, I'm jewish myself.""

70509,"A continuation of the previous thread about difficult but rewarding reads. I'm currently reading Vineland by Pynchon. Truth be told, I'm not finding it that difficult. Granted, it's the 3rd Pynchon novel I've read, so I know his obsessions and am familiar with his literary style. Still ... ""Vineland"" reads like a really polished Tom Robbins book, since his books also have pot-smoking iconoclasts and Sixties refugees. This isn't downgrading Pynchon in the least, nor giving Robbins any undue praise. Robbins is a great author, he just doesn't float my boat right now. While ""Vineland"" is supposedly the ""weakest"" of Pynchon's novels -- define ""weak"" -- it's definitely on a different level than, say, Gravity's Rainbow and Mason and Dixon But ""Vineland"", thus far, I'm 100+ pages into it, is consistently funny, whereas his other short novel, Crying of Lot 49 contains more dread and conspiracies. And the cliche goes, ""Drama is easy, comedy is hard."" Another consideration, ""Vineland"" is considered ""weak"", but that was during the early 90s, when the Reagan Dream was still alive and kicking. How does ""Vineland"" read following the political travesties and genocide of the Dubya years, combined with the death throes of neoconservative laissez faire capitalism with the Great Recession of 2009? Pop commercial books like those written by Balzac and Dickens were meat and potatoes literature for the masses in Victorian times. Now we need footnotes just to figure out references and literary allusions. ""Vineland"" is fun because I actually know a majority of the references and I grew up during the 80s.

71853,"I'm trying to recall a book from my childhood 30 years ago, that may well have been old even then. A family of children decide that when Saturdays come around none of them has enough money to afford what they would really like to do...so they begin a plan to pool their pocket money, so each can have a wonderful day out every few weeks. It's a story of their altruism, the specialness and differences in what matters to them. Simple heartwarming stuff. I conflate this in my mind with the children moving to a magical house with a turret from which they can look over the town/countryside around. I don;t know if the title reflects the club they create, which may also have been the Saturday club? I equate the book in my mind with authors like EE Nesbit or similar.",yes

For those who don't know, I think we decided to split the book up in two parts to avoid spoilers. I figure the first half could be the beginning to Day Three: Morning - that seems to be about the halfway point in my book - and the second part of the group read can be the last half of the book.

73151,"ChocolateMuse has convinced me to try this, so here goes! I read far more than 50 books per year, but you guys won't kick me out for that, will you? :) My latest read  which is actually a reread, and that I have a few more pages to finish  is Robin McKinley's The Blue Sword. Absolutely wonderful fantasy, strong in every way. My review: The Blue Sword is one of my ultimate comfort reads, the rare sort of novel that you first encounter in your teens that only gets better every time you revisit it. Of Robin McKinley's fine body of work, this novel is arguably one of the best, and proves her place as one of the best fantasy authors writing today.  A young woman named Harry  short for her hated name, Angharad  has come to the border town of Istan in Damar, a possession of the Homeland crown, as a charity case. Her brother is a subaltern in Her Majesty's army, and when their father died he was left with an entailed estate and an unmarried sister on his hands. Harry is extremely tall and awkward, lacking the beauty that might have made her position easier. Though Lady Amelia and Sir Charles are kindness itself to Harry, her real comfort in her new life is derived from a secret joy in the harsh, beautiful desert. Little does she know that she is about to involuntarily make its acquaintance on much closer terms  and join a desperate attempt to save Damar from the onrush of the demonic Northern army. What a brilliant idea, to model a fantasy world from life during historical British imperialist rule. ""Homeland"" is very similar to England, and its characters are properly British in their ideas and manners. Damar's desert culture provides a lovely backdrop for the action of the story, and becomes more than that over the course of the story. It is almost a character in its own right, and forms a large part of the characters' motivations. This is definitely a fantasy novel to read for its world-building. The characters are wonderful. Harry is fascinating because she is very observant and stubborn, though she tries to meet the expectations of those around her. Her wry sense of humor makes the events of the story feel believable, and she is a good judge of character. But we also get to see her insecurities and fears, which make her accessible and well rounded. I love the snippets of magic and history that we get, that are later explained in The Hero and the Crown. Corlath is also well written, and of course Tsornin and Mathin and the others all have distinct personalities conveyed well in a few words.  McKinley's economy of language is so precise and tight. Every word adds something meaningful to the story, lets us in a little closer to what is happening both externally and within the characters. This isn't always the case with her work  the denouments of several of her novels are so wildly descriptive and powerful that they are sometimes unclear as to what is actually taking place  but this doesn't happen here. The end of the story is as satisfying as the language in which it is told. And as I was rereading this time, I couldn't help but wish for a really faithful film adaptation of this story. It would amazing onscreen if it were done well, if the actors could convey all the unspoken undercurrents in the relationships.  With its tight plot, compelling characters, authentic cultures, and deft writing, The Blue Sword is a wonderful example of top-notch fantasy writing. It's one of my all-time favorite books, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  (Re)read 9/13/09-9/14/09",no

Robertson places this novel squarely in the early 1940s both explicitly (dating things by year and month) as well as implicitly. He does the latter by means of using some of the following period ideas/items/actions that were prevalent at that time. Consider the following list, and add memories of yours that these items conjure up: 	Hollywood stars-Veronica Lake/Alan Ladd/Boris Karloff/Dorothy Lamour/Errol Flynn/Loretta Young 	Radio shows 	Cartoons 	Double features at the movie houses 	Gas rationing and car stickers 	Brothers and dads being drafted into military service 	GReenwich 1212 phone number 	General Douglas A. MacArthurnews of the war overseas 2.	This story could be a coming-of-age novel or a quest novel. Which do you think it is? Could it be both? It has been compared to Tom Sawyer, Catcher in the Rye, The Outsider, Pernod, To Kill a Mockingbird, A Christmas Story, A Prayer for Owen Meany, Peace Like a River, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, Hiroshima and The Road. If you have read some of these, do you agree or disagree, and why?  3.	The novel mentions many references to games and things that happen in a childs experience both of the early 1940s as well as to all children. Consider some of these and share how they affected your own memories of childhood: 	Rectal temperatures at the doctors office 	Playing jacks 	Trading baseball cards/ throwing cards at a wall to score points 	Speaking pig Latin 	Pulling a sibling in a wagon 	Calling classmates by names such asThe Pill, A Slop, A Goof, A Brain, Human Garbage Can, etc. 4.	Why does the author have Morris Bird III use combined words all through the book? What purpose do you think it serves? 	Candystore/ candybars/ selfrespect/ 	Allofasudden/ funnylooking/ oldmaidish/ 	Schoolyard/ movingvan/ telegraphpoles/ 	Sixthgraders/ thirdbest/ lefthanded/ halfadozen/ 	Peanutbutter/ socalled/ earthshattering/ 	Handsoccer/ watchpocket/  5.	Why do you think there are no chapters in this book? What do you see as the purpose of the 9-pg. long paragraph starting on pg. 48? 6.	Morris Bird III calls everyone by their full name, except his immediate family and those adults whose names he doesnt know. Of the latter, (e.g. the legless man, the poor burnt lady, the kind Red Cross lady, the tall black lady) one is reminded of the characters in the novel Blindness. What are the similarities and differences in the way these nameless people are used in both stories? Why do you think Morris refers to the others with their full names? 7.	Morris Bird has trouble sleeping at night and is made physically ill by the psychological pain he feels over betrayals he has made, and by morally ambiguous situations he has let slide during his young life. He feels guilt and has an overactive conscience for a 7-9 yr. old boy. Discuss some of these situations. How do these betrayals play into his decision to take his trip to the other side of Cleveland? 8.	Prior to reading this novel, were you aware of the tragic 1944 gas explosion in Cleveland, OH? Were you impelled to find out if this was a fictitious or an exaggerated historical happening? 9.	Stanley Chaloupkas appearance and behavior make it probable that he had Asperger Syndromea high-functioning autism. Have you known anyone with Asperger autistic spectrum disorder? If you have, were you both repulsed and fascinated/drawn to the person with this condition? Was this person obsessively interested in one or two major interests? 10.	When Morris was in the hospital recovering from his appendectomy, he let the other children play with his toys, and felt that if he was nice to them, he could start to make better the awful thing he had done to his mother? Do you see atonement as a theme in this book? 11. On page 97 (of 211) Morris gets started on his long walk to Stanley Chaloupkas house across town. Why are MorrisGrandmother and teacher, Mrs. Dallas, instrumental in his decision to plan his long walk? What stories led to his decision to make such a journey?  12. The title of this book is a clichThe Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread. Consider that the novel is riddled with clichs. Why do you think the author wrote in this way? What was the effect of having so many characters speak using clichs? Consider the following as examples:   	More _____ than Mr. Carter had pills 	Get it when the gettings good 	Put on the dog 	Allowances had to be made 	Off his feed 	The neighborhood had seen better days 	Stand up and be counted  	Dont let the world pass you by 	Makes my flesh run cold 	Losing himself in the crowd 	Wouldnt have scared a rabbit 	The man in the white coat 	Anything was better than nothing at all 	A man among men   13. Besides Morris Bird IIIs storyline, there are several others that begin the same time that our protagonist is about to set out on his odyssey. Miss Edna Daphne Frost, retired teacher and later referred to as the tall black ladys story is one such character, as are Leo Bernstein and his wife Naomi Segal Bernstein. Another character is Mrs. Barbara Sternad, whose husband was stationed in England. Harry Wrobleski, a senior in high school went to the football game at his school the day of Morriss long walk. Mrs. Imogene Brookes, an unhappy young mother having an adulterous affair with her next door neighbor is also featured, as is Casimir Redlich, a disabled former railroad worker. We are given glimpses into these peoples lives, though it isnt apparent why. They all converge, playing a role in our heros life on the day of the gas explosion. Do you like this effect? Can you think of other books which use this devise? Is it effective in this novel? ",no

75781,"So here's an initial thread on Clarel. Write what you will. Introduce yourself. Maybe say something about whether you'll read or why you'll read. The formal reading will begin on the Winter Equinox, and I'll start a thread for the first book then. In the interim, we can talk about editions, secondary sources, white whales or gossip in general, or just post good old fashioned Melville jokes. To begin. For those of us who have haunted Melville before, we know that names are usually important and odd, so I begin my own pondering with Clarel's name. ""Clarel"" is both the name of the poem and its central figure, a theology student on pilgrimage to the holy land. I resorted to Google for my first inquiry and came up with the following: From ""Too Intellectual a Poet to Ever be Popular: Herman Melville and the Miltonic Dimension of Clarel"" (John T. Shawcross, 2002): ""The name of the character has long been pondered; Bezanson offers no meaning, and Helene Rozenberg-Sacks says, without discussion, ""Clarel himself standing for `clarity,' not without some touch of dramatic irony."" (26) Its pronunciation is ""CLAR el"" (see Bezanson, p. 507 n.1). The concerns of the poem ranging between religious ideas of the western world and the Semitic and Hebraic world have long been observed (and implied earlier). The name, in fact, denotes that fusion of the past and the present, the Semitic and the non-Semitic, and is ultimately not ironic. Its etymology may involve the Latin clarus, meaning ""clear, bright, brilliant"" as Rozenberg-Sacks implies plus the Hebraic el, meaning ""God."" (27) Rather, it has relation to the Greek GREEK TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII, an epithet of Zeus in Aeschylus's Supplices, 360, and Pausanias Periegata, VIII, liii, 9, as well as an epithet of Apollo (Phoebus Apollo, identified with Christ) in Revue de Philologie, Nouvelle Serie, XXII, 260. The name thus combines the Greek (as in the New Testament) with the Hebraic (as in the Old Testament) for ""God."" Interestingly, Shirley M. Dettlaff investigates this general fusion in ""`Counter Natures in Mankind': Hebraism and Hellenism in Clarel."" She sees the Hellenic as male and head, the Hebraic as female and heart, with Clarel favoring the darker Hebraic view, and extends the debate between the Graeco-Roman or Judaeo-Christian to a classic theory of human personality or a romantic one. These, conflicting, ""must be combined to provide a complete definition of man,"" and quoting August Schlegel, she says, one ""must never relax `into the stasis of finite satisfaction.'"" (28) Her conclusion, echoing many other commentators, is ""He has not found truth, freedom, or wholeness. He does not achieve a synthesis of the Hebraic and the Hellenic, as did Rolfe. He does not accept his fate. He simply suffers"" (Dettlaff, p. 217). It is clear that I firmly disagree, reading the epilogue (and the immediately preceding sections) as a synthesis--but not that which would represent ""orthodox"" or ""standard"" religious positions, or Rolfe. (29) The synthesis involves rejection of the ""philosophies"" paraded by means of the people whom Clarel meets, including the human love motif that many commentators have stressed. As Warren Rosenberg writes, ""Clarel is forced to experience the confusion of eros and intellect.... Clarel must find a balance between the views of woman as ultimate source of evil and as embodiment of ideal virtue.""

I thought about a Group Read  la Mac's Halloween Group...but I know most of us don't have a lot of free moments around the holidays as it is and Group Reads can certainly put time stress on anyone.  Still, I thought it might be nice to have a centralized thread where people who are inclined to this sort of thing might mention books about the holidays that they are reading or have read and give us their reactions. For my part, I'm always looking for another story that captures that elusive quality of being heart-warming without being sappy. A Christmakwanzakah kind of thing where everyone is welcome. If some of us end up sharing some reading and discussing the books, that's will be wonderful. If not, we can all have suggestions for the next year. Last year, I read Paul Aster's Auggie Wren's Christmas Story and Edna Ferber's No Room at the Inn and enjoyed them...both were recommended...and, of course, my annual re-read of O.

Thanks again for any help. ************************************************* Jan Goldberg a.k.a. Horst Vogel is a Polish Jew who was a resistance fighter against the Nazis. We meet up with him about 5 years after the end of the war and he is masquerading as a German art specialist trying to separate out the seized war booty from legitimate art holdings. He also keeps an eye out for known stolen works. What most don't know, he is also an assassin who brings 'justice' to Nazis who were instrumental in the party's purge but have escaped the notice of the War crimes tribunal. The story opens with our protagonist committing a grisly murder in an alley outside a seedy bar. We don't know who either of the players are but one was permanently removed from the game. He follows this closely by taking out another Nazi trying to escape to Argentina via Switzerland on a train. The book starts out gritty and it looks like it it going to have a high body count, then Horst has a chance meeting with Greta, a beautiful blond German pianist, as she was staring into a stream looking for a ring she had dropped. Horst is able to retrieve it for her and she repays him by having coffee with him. This starts our protagonist down the road from hardened, embittered, assassin to a caring man who wants to settle down and raise a family. About a third of the way into the story we finally do a flash back and learn about Jan's past and how he became the man we meet in the beginning of the story.  I found this to be a very engaging book and I wanted to keep reading it. I thought it was well written but the end just seemed a little too 'storybook' perfect in my opinion, I liked the ending and I certainly can't think of a way to make it better, but it seemed to be missing something. Overall, a good book worth reading, but don't mistake this for a hard core spy novel, it's more a light love story and about the wounds a war causes and how they heal.",no

78783,"I've just read When We Were Orphans. I found it quite a puzzling book, so I'd be very interested in other people's opinions. A quick summary of the story: Christopher Banks is a celebrated detective in 1930s London. But he is driven by the memory of a long-ago mystery - the disappearance of his parents when he was a small boy and the family lived in Shanghai, where his father worked for a trading company and his mother campaigned against the British-run opium trade. Eventually he is able to return to Shanghai to carry out his own researches - but is he prepared for what he will find there? Despite this, the main focus of the novel seems to be Christopher's own personality. He is the narrator, with a very distinctive pedantic and dry voice - he lives very much in his own head and is rather an unreliable narrator - all this is quite reminiscent of the butler character in The Remains Of The Day.  I think the big problem for me with this book was that it didn't quite seem to hang together. In the first part of the book there were so many things which looked as if they were going to be leading somewhere - for example, Christopher's clearly unreliable memories of his past, the ambitions of the character of Sarah Hemmings, or the recurring references to a growing evil in the world. I didn't feel that any of these were ever really resolved.  There were also some implausibilities which got to me - for some reason, I found the fact that Christopher was meant to be a ""famous detective"" quite difficult in the context of a supposedly realistic story. Also, the idea that resolving his parents' case would in some way put an end to the world's growing evil would have been fine if it was an indication of his monomania, but other characters also seemed to buy into it.  Perhaps, thinking about it, the lack of resolution was deliberate - the message being that you can think that your life has a certain shape and direction, only to have that completely overturned. There certainly seems to be a theme that you can be implicated in the most awful things without realising. But for me this still ended up a frustrating read.",no

They enslaved the humans with a net metal cap with electrodes (or something) going into their brains. The humans were worked to death or killed when they were no longer needed.

79391,"Hey guys! I've held off posting a couple of reviews here because I haven't seen anyone else submit anything. I hope I'm not making the group a one man show. Well, here for your perusal is a review of Deeper, a not so good horror story that I just finished. --- Deeper sounded like just my kind of horror story. A captain is hired at the end of the season to take a professor and his students on a thirty day trip to explore some underwater caves. Deeper is James A. Moores sequel to H.P. Lovecrafts The Shadow Over Innsmouth. Surely thats a goldmine for a horror story. Unfortunately, the author just doesnt do much with it. The author constantly tells what is happening, but he never shows what is happening. As a result, the book never seemed to connect with me. The book is narrated by a New England sea captain, yet he was never given a distinctive voice. There were no 'little details' or real nautical slang that would have shown me that the author did his homework and would have made the captain a believable character. An entire novel where the captain never says 'port', 'starboard', 'berth' or 'head'? All of the characters really were pretty flat, two dimensional and interchangeable. The biggest sin of the book though is that it just isn't scary. If Mr. Moore is going to write a Lovecraft inspired story he should also learn to carry off some Lovecraft-style cosmic dread. Nobody in this story seemed to understand that they were in a horror story. At one point, the crew have an encounter with a fish-man. Yet nobody seemed to be particularly freaked out by it. There was none of the awe and wonder that you would expect at the discovery of another sentient humanoid race. No fear, terror or looming madness. Nothing. At 270 pages, this was a fairly short book, but I felt no connection to the characters or any spark to the events of the story. For such a short book, it really felt like a slog. Ultimately the biggest problem with Deeper is that it just lacked depth.",no

79645,"Hi First off, I'm not very well read at all in western philosophy. I've read Russell's History plus bits and pieces, started a few classics and finished fewer. I've long been curious about certain things relating to philosophy, language and society but I was never able to grasp the connection between them and to phrase just what it is I'm curious about. Relevant jigsaw pieces that I've accumulated include Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, Bergson's intuition, William James's ""On Some Omissions of Introspective Psychology"", Gilbert Ryle's The Concept of Mind, Zhuangzi, zen buddhism and the concept of linguistic relativity. Today I had the needed epiphany: I want to grasp the entire silk road of data that leads from reality to consciousness and then to thought, language and ultimately societywhat can be said of its workings, how we use it, how it can be conceptualized, how it transforms and distorts that which passes through it.

This thread is for discussion of power relationships and after BushCo, more specifically how language mediates those relationships.  We are all familiar with the cant associated with our industries/jobs. Insiders and outsiders are identified by the language they use. Oligarchs recognize one another by the language they use and obfuscate their intentions through Orwellian language. Just consider ""Death Panels"". City folk often look down about country folk because of the language differences between them, particularly the level of diction. How do we use these in our communications strategies. I've only read one book on this topic, Language and Symbolic Power by Pierre Bourdieu. I'm interested in examples of how language is used to create segregated spaces between groups of people who ostensibly speak the same language, but through word choice and accent create different impressions and as a result wield more or less power than the other.

So I am is spending most of the time I am not doing child care, down at my mother's. And the good times just keep rolling........... Saturday after watching our lab, (who turned 1 Thanksgiving), take forever to get up and then hop on her hind feet, we took her to the Veterinary Animal Hospital. And yes, even at just 1 yr of age, she has hip dysplasia and her knee joints are extremely inflamed. $10,000.00 in U.S.D. for the hip replacements; the vet opted for medical intervention and then perhaps surgery to remove the top of the ball of her hip joint, if necessary. Dear hubby and the Dr. Fay, (who also has a yellow lab and has been Abby's vet since birth), were all in tears. So she gets a shot every Wed. and Sat. and three medications daily. She is not so crazy about the fish oil that we must put on her food and has stopped eating. We figure that when she gets hungry enough, she will eat it. It is strange. One day she was getting up and moving fine and within 3 days she was at the Vet's. Our vet says that usually when they are that young and develop this, it does come on rather quickly. She is better already. AND NOW THE GOOD TIMES ARE REALLY ROLLING.............................................. On a lighter note; I am now a Great grandmother. Our 23 year old grand daughter, Erin, gave birth evening before last to a beautiful bouncing baby girl. Weighing in at 8 lbs. 1 oz and 19 inches long, our little Madisen Lena is just a bundle of joy!~! So go to my profile page and please meet Maidsen Lena.

I generally read about 75 to 100 books a year, I would imagine, on average finishing about two a week, some weeks more, some a little less. I am also a writer. Generally genealogy texts and lineages. I have also written ""memoir-type"" recollections. I am currently working on a fiction that combines my love of genealogy and research with romance. (It's tentatively titled ""I Found Them On The Sofa""; a tale about modern geneaogy research on the Internet.) I am also a full-time genealogist, with my office in my home. My husband is a long-haul truck driver, so I spend days on end on my own with my keyboard and books as my only companions. Well, my cat Fred, and my Chihuahua, Chica, are always by my side! Since I've just joined the group, I will begin my count with the last two books I've finished so far this year (there are more, but I will start from this point): Darwin's Radio by Greg Bear. While a bit complex for the average reader, having been a nurse for thirteen years I was able to keep up, but even so the technicality of molecular bio-geneticism was a bit above my head at times! And the story-line was somewhat lacking. I would go so far as to call it ""cookie-cutter"", as it was much too easy to determine the ending. It was one of those reads that I was glad to put down when it ended. 700 Sundays by Billy Crystal was just completed last evening. It was a simply ""mah-velous"" read! The only flaw I found in it? I wasn't ready for it to end! This was a read that I could have continued for a long time yet! Who would have thunk that the boy from Long Island was just as good a storyteller as he is a comedian? But then, it was a story worth the telling! I am currently reading The Best-Loved Poems of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis by Caroline Kennedy. As an amateur poet, I have loved reading and reciting poetry since I was very small. I once honored to be in the crowd when Rose Kennedy recited ""The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere"". And she did it from memory! (She was quite the elderly woman at the time, too! I was amazed!) I am this point in this book, where I am currently reading this wonderful patritotic poem of the daring ride, again.

My books tend to be heavy on speculative/science fiction, but over the course of a year some thrillers and mysteries make it in. Sometimes historical fiction as well. I count the digest magazines such as Fantasy & Science Fiction or Analog as books read. I'll try and include mini-reviews for most books. and stars. 1 star awful. I'm not likely to finish and so won't get reviewed. 1.5 stars below average with problems, but some good saves it 2 stars below average but not awful 2.5-3 stars is an average book for me. 3.5 stars above average 4 stars really good 4.5-5 stars are rare and for the exceptional books So far for 2010: 1. Breathless by Dean Koontz  . finished 1/14/2010 2 stars This is a story told in the old fashioned style where each chapter jumps from character to character and ultimately we hope to see each of the separate short stories all come together in the end. Parts of the book I liked a lot, especially the first half or a bit more of the book; some interesting ideas and most of the characters are well drawn and interesting - but it ultimately didn't really work for me - in any event I found myself disappointed at the end. Koontz's writing is pretty good in this one - he manages some great imagery in his text without going over the top - but some cliched characters and activity drug it down some. The end just seemed silly. 2. The Warrior's Apprentice by Lois McMaster Bujold   . finished 1/19/2010 3 stars+ This was my first tentative step into Bujold's Barrayar/Miles Vorkosigan series of books. It was a tad too space opera for me, but it kept my interest and I enjoyed the wide and varied cast of characters. The culture is interesting. A lot of improbable happenings sorta kept the lid on my enthusiasm, but for a tale of a young man's wild adventure off planet it was fun. Almost, but not quite, what I would consider a young adult book. 3. The Mountains of Mourning by Lois McMaster Bujold  .  finished 1/30/2010 4 stars I read the Hugo and Nebula winning ""The Mountains of Mourning"" following ""The Warrior's Apprentice"" and I am glad I did. This story, remarkable on its own merits, added a lot to the background culture of the planet Barrayar. I can see now how people would get hooked on this series of books and I look forward to reading additional stories in the Vorkosigan saga. In the Mountains of Mourning, young Miles Vorkosigan is fresh out of the Academy on a short break before assignment. He finds a road-weary woman pleading at the gates of the estate and sends her to his father to hear her plea. Miles is then dispatched by his father the Count to solve a possible murder (infanticide) in a far district. The characters are really well defined and written, as is the whole story. This was very different from ""The Warrior's Apprentice"" which was almost too space opera for me, and I can't wait to read the next in the timeline, ""The Vor Game"". 4. The Vor Game by Lois Mcmaster Bujold   . finished 2/9/2010 about 3 stars Liked it well enough but found it not a terribly strong novel. It perhaps has too many echoes of The Warrior's Apprentice in the latter half of the book, but it benefits from a cast of characters that includes some from the prior stories, although mostly in limited ways. I liked getting a better handle on the emperor Gregor here.

8497,"A brief public service announcement for the literal-minded among us: PLEASE NOTE THE POST BELOW WAS MEANT AS SATIRE. THE PASSAGES ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THOSE PICKED FROM ANOTHER THREAD LINKING SOME MUSLIMS WITH ""NAZIS""; WHILE THE POLITICAL POINTS MENTIONED ARE RELEVANT, THEY WERE NOT MEANT IN COMPLETE SERIOUSNESS. It is not the average American that really matters when we talk about the new Fascism. It is the statements and actions of the governments and organizations within America. The average American was not a Fascist. All he/she wanted was a little peace to run a business, raise a family, and have a little fun. When the moderate and sane politicians come through, it will just be a different set of people making decisions about their lives. However, they are complicit through their votes and their non-resistance. Remember, more than 70% of the country was in favour of the two wars and supported Bush after the WTC attack. The average American doesn't drop bombs in crowded civilian areas from 30,000 feet in the air to get his/her monthly paycheck and claim that the bombs are inaccurate or that war is unfair and it's too bad. But I believe that he/she is complicit on account of his/her votes and continual flag-waving support (which I believe is Oakes' and markmobley's point). I know that there are voices against the war within the closeted American media and redneck worldview, but then there were people who criticized Mussolini, too. So, are they the new Fascists? The Fascists believed they were saving the world, and all other countries were inferior, to be 'liberated' or simply ignored until a war was commenced. America, as defined by the majority of the American conservatives or politicians, check. The Fascists were nationalists, the American conservatives and politicians centralized around, well, America. Parallel, but not exactly the same. The Fascists were basically corporatist, believing that any kind of social aid or system was part of a Communist agenda. American governments? Check. The Fascists were militaristic in culture. American governments? Check, with exceptions. Perhaps there are mitigating factors that no one has covered yet. Clearly, there were periods in American history when America was not overtly engaged in imperialism and war. But in those periods too, America was often contributing to imperialism and the overthrow of popularly elected governments elsewhere, particularly if they were hostile to American corporatism, imperialism or seemed even slightly left-wing. Even before the start of the Afghan/Iraqi invasions, America was spending at least $40 billion a year on the military, two to four times that the second biggest spender China, a country that has over three times the population, and more than the next ten countries combined. How much poverty and other factors that lead to fundamentalism would $40 billion resolve? Plenty. Didn't Mussolini state that ""Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power."" And what has America done in the last five years or so? The government is currently investigating billions of dollars in kickbacks and contracts handed over to corporations before or during the current invasion of Iraq, many of which were affiliated with those IN the government.  How much clearer could the analogy be? All of this was done in the name of freedom (among other things), liberating Iraq from a terrible dictator (while taking help from other authoritarian nations) and the continual refrain now, to deflect criticism, is to ""Support The Troops."" And didn't the Doctrine of Fascism also state: ""(The state) is not simply a mechanism which limits the sphere of the supposed liberties of the individual"" & ""Neither has the Fascist conception of authority anything in common with that of a police ridden State"" but rather clearly connoting ""Far from crushing the individual, the Fascist State multiplies his energies, just as in a regiment a soldier is not diminished but multiplied by the number of his fellow soldiers"" I think the similarities are there if you use my constraints. Are Americans ACTUAL Fascists? No, of course not. There are thankfully very few real Fascists around these days. (A bit of European, particularly Soviet, military force, sixty or so years ago, took care of that problem.) But are Americans LIKE Fascists in relevant ways? Yes. Will happily cite statements by American politicians some time. Too tired now. Intrigued that no one has actually referenced any texts yet. Please feel free to dispute me with favorite references from popular American media sources. However, I will not take seriously any responses of the well, any text can be interpreted in different ways variety. Words have meaning, and can often fix traditions along fairly set courses. The American Constitution has a number of apparently divergent interpretations, yet there have been traditional ways of resolving these discrepancies along accepted lines, namely limiting the freedom of the press, increasing government vigilance, bureaucracy and spending, and so on and so forth. Isn't it ironic that a so-called Conservative government against government intervention in private affairs, against ""nation-building"", and that constantly heckles government ""spenders"" when a little is thrown towards the incredibly poor sections of American society, does much the same and in the most immoral way, for the most immoral reasons? In my view, the current American political-corporate sphere is on the whole a self-contained, wicked and pernicious world -- a true Fascist state if there ever was one -- and the chief reason why American actions in the recent past have been, on the whole, wicked and pernicious. Just pointing out that I am not lumping ALL Americans together ... although I think Conservatives here are underestimating how many Americans (AND people of other political persuasions) would be pretty much fine with killing off foreign civilians if the government called them Communists, Islamic Terrorists, or some other Threat To Your Fun, Freedom and SUV ... now that's something that was true with vast numbers of the Fascist party.

The language and images were pretty dire. And then I think ""By most metrics things are much worse now, in the Bush/Obama recession. Yet I don't feel the media doom-and-gloom is as intense.

Charts like http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/comparing-this-recession-to-previou... don't tell the full story. (Comparing unemployment from the start of a recession makes recessions that started from a lousy recovery look better; unemployment in '83 hit almost 11%.) 3.

I am actually concerned not so much with the aesthetic appeal of the book - this feature is often commented upon in current posts - but more with the content of the book. In short, is the book an informative and/or enjoyable read, and why? To get started, I thought I'd comment on The Belton Estate by Trollope which I obtained on e-Bay. I am a Trollope enthusiast, so my comments must be taken in context. The forward of the book warns that this is not a popular work, perhaps because of its realism - in particular, the lack of eccentric characters. However, I am enjoying the book immensely. One of the reasons I have trouble with Dickens is that I find his characters (especially the women) a bit too stereotyped and/or bizarre. I think Trollope has great insight and I enjoy his nuances.

87239,"There were 2 stories in this collection that I remember well, though both titles and authors are forgotten. The first involved a man thrown into a prison that was a giant underground device that rotated. The prisoners had to pull ropes for a set amount of time every day to make the prison turn. Eventually, their cell would rotate around to the outside world and they would be released. There were gaps or irregularities in the walls that would appear every so often, allowing some movement between cells. Actually, I'd be happy if anyone could just identify this story. The second story involved a guy who had some sort of strange parasite like a slug (described as seal brown?) and he could only get rid of it by convincing some other person that his story was true and the parasite would then move to the new host. What else I remember: I am reasonably sure I got this through the Scholastic Book Club, but it does not appear to have been published by Scholastic themselves. The cover may have been either a dark teal/petrol or a rusty brown. The first story may, but only may, have been The Willows by Algernon Blackwood.

87606,"I ordered a book in 2003 or 2004 called The Sixteenth Round by Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter and it's about his life as a boxer and how he went from the top contender for the middle weight boxing crown to a prisoner after witnesses testified that he was one of the shooters, along with a young fan named John Artis, of multiple murders in Paterson, New Jersey. Years later, it was discovered that the witnesses and the prosecuters put the wrong people in prison, but by then the damages were already done! Both men lost years of their lives, and Carter's marriage had ended years before, when he and his lawyers were caught up in dozens of appeals with the New Jersey and U.S. Judicial Systems.

Usually these are respected texts, but unlikely to have been read by high school students.  This particular excerpt takes place on a train in India. I think it is told in first person. The protagonist is a man, possibly in his 20s and he's sitting across from an older man and his daughter and another traveller. The other traveller has a sore throat and so can only whisper so they protagonist also whispers causing the older man to believe that they are talking about his daughter.

88147,"I just posted this to a fantasy forum I don't think I can actually post to, but in case it worked, please forgive me for the cross-posting. I work in a library, but I don't buy the books. Lately, it seems like all the fantasy we are buying are edgy urban fantasies (with required belly shirt on cover, or long black coat, or both) and vampire or zombie books. I am sure they do a lively business, but I don't want to read them. When I asked our buyers for some nice old-fashioned fantasy, they challenged me to find some. My office mate and I have tried a lot of fantasy book sites and are coming up dry. So I am turning to the collective brain. It is shaping up to be a good Young Adult Fantasy year--but not such a good one for Adults. Since I am the one asking, I like male protagonists and likable, well developed characters and no elves or werewolves or gods or the like. Any suggestions?",yes

Don't hold me to that, though. About the only thing I can recall is that in one scene, someone was playing ""Nearer My God to Thee"" on an organ, and whoever could hear it was in or near a cave in a cliff overlooking a large body of water.

On the other hand, having looked at the books under each tag, they do seem to be used in much the same way.

88386,"Stardust by Neil Gaiman  My Review Charmingly grown up short fairy tale - complete with the expected darker undertones. The Victorian village of Wall lies a day's drive from London, and yet is in mountainous terrain - perhaps S. Wales. It's called Wall because at the back of the village across some fields is a large high stone wall with just one narrow gap in it. Beyond the gap lies the faerie realm. Once every nine years the fae hold a market of world renown in these meadows. And so our story opens with a humble villager exploring the delights on offer. These include a cat-eared and violet-eyed storeholder's assistant. Unfortunately, a stretchable chain restricts her freedom, but in due course a child is born, and returned to Wall.  Tristran Thorne he is christened and raised all unaware of his fae heritage. One evening while out courting his sweetheart, they observe a star falling on the far side of the wall, ""If you fetch me that I'll grant you your heart's desire"" says she. Of such rash promises are ever lover's quests born. And so, all unprepared, does Tristain enter the world of Faerie.  As you might expect he briefly meets a variety of inhabitants, wise, fair and beautiful, as well as of course mendacious, false and ugly. He finds the star very quickly, and is surprised to learn that in Faerie stars are beautiful girls who sing haunting melodies - and have a sharp temper. Their journey back takes much longer, and Tristran never realises that many other people have an interest in the heart of a star. All too soon he's back at the fair and forced to choose between the star and his sweetheart on the other side of the wall. There are plenty of unexplained loose ends, and plot holes, such as how the chained assistant manages to have a child whilst under the sway of Madam Sempa; who/what the Fellowship are; etc. It could have been a much longer story, but then it probably wouldn't have the charming simpleness of this one. We're spared all the heavy morals that are sometimes larded over fairy tales, and left to draw our own conclusions. However there is nothing particularly insightful here, none of Pratchett's subtle commentary or Carroll's insights into life, it is just a charming, short, story - with a very sad ending. From what I've read of him, this is distinctly at the lighter, sweeter end of his work, and so may not appeal to all his fans. But the darker parts probably won't appeal to many traditionalists either. An enjoyable read for an hour or two (it won't take any longer). In the afterword he talks about a more serious Prequel, and maybe some other works set in or around Wall. I suspect if these ever appear they will provide the only motivation in wanting to read this again. All discussion welcome.",no

89266,"Please do not allow yourself to think of these as comic books for adults. They have gone far beyond that. My favorite G.N.'s are:  Anything, and everything, by Georges Pichard,     Especially his Magnum Opus 'Marie-Gabrielle de Saint-Eutrope' (1977) (ISBN 1-56163-138-8) which illustrates the ordeals of a beautiful, and voluptuous, woman who accidentally shoots her nobleman husband and is sentenced to fifteen years hard labor, mostly while nude. This is superb BDSM Erotica!  Other works by Pichard include:  'Madoline'(1996) Parts 1 & 2, and 'The Road to Repentance' (1992) although this is much less erotic than most. Another great master of the genre is Brian Tarsis with his masterpiece 'City of Dreams, a Tale of Erotic Fantasy' (1996) (ISBN 1-56097-224-6) which is the graphic novel version of the 'Beauty Trilogy' and one of the best-drawn graphic novels ever.  Another excellent set of works for the Bi-sexual world is;  'The Spider Garden' (1995)  'Lumenagerie' (1996)  'Cathexis' (1997)  'In a Metal Web (2003) & 'In a Metal Web II' (2003) These are set in a magical fantasy world styled much like extreme Japanese erotic fetish creations. A magnificent addition to the field of lesbian BDSM is 'The Thorn Garden' (1997) by Meroe Elahi and Wilfred (ISBN 1-56097-293-9). It involves a young woman seeking her first experience with 'Fisting'. And let us not forget the classic works by Eric Stanton; 'Blunder Broad' which, interestingly enough, has the text in three languages; English, Italian and French. (ISBN 88-8275-028-0 & 88-8275-029-9) Blunder Broad is a flawed Super Hero who meets her match and has to endure very intimate assaults intended to break her spirit.  Lastly is the somewhat incomprehensible quasi-sci-fi story 'Birdland' (1990) (ISBN 1-56097-200-9) by Gilbert Hernandez. This story is too bizarre even to summarize, but is wildly erotic even though it is not truly a BDSM story. Unfortunately, many of these are no longer in print but you can always add them to your Wishlist in BookMooch. I might even add them to my Inventory there, but these are so good and valuable that I may consider selling them instead. ",no

89561,"Hi Everyone! Just wanted to give you details about an event I am co-hosting at Open Books on Saturday, May 8th at 3:00pm! Spotlight On Literacy: Economic Oppression Film Viewing And Book Discussion Open Books is proud to put the spotlight on literacy! The Spotlight series is comprised of quarterly events that confront literacy problems through the lens of current social issues. Our first Spotlight event will focus on the effects of economic oppression. We will be watching the movie Waging a Living and discussing the book The Working Poor: Invisible in America by David Shipler.  About the movie: Waging a Living chronicles the day-to-day battles of four low-wage earners fighting to lift their families out of poverty. Shot over a three-year period in the northeast and California, this observational documentary captures the dreams, frustrations, and accomplishments of a diverse group of people who struggle to live from paycheck to paycheck. By presenting an unvarnished look at the barriers that these workers must overcome to lift their families out of poverty, Waging a Living offers a sobering view of the elusive American Dream. About the book: This guided and very personal tour through the lives of the working poor shatters the myth that America is a country in which prosperity and security are the inevitable rewards of gainful employment. Armed with an encyclopedic collection of artfully deployed statistics and individual stories, Shipler, former New York Times reporter and Pulitzer winner for Arab and Jew, identifies and describes the interconnecting obstacles that keep poor workers and those trying to enter the work force after a lifetime on welfare from achieving economic stability. This America is populated by people of all races and ethnicities, whose lives, Shipler effectively shows, are Sisyphean, and that includes the teachers and other professionals who deal with the realities facing the working poor. Publishers Weekly The Open Books store will soon have a limited number of copies of The Working Poor available for purchase at $9 each! Come pick up a copy, read it, and then come discuss with us at the debut of this important new series! This is a FREE event! May 8 3 - 6 pm Open Books - Literacy Center 213 W. Institute Pl.

89716,"Girl with a Pearl Earring By Tracy Chevalier Girl with a Pearl Earring is a fictional account of a 16-year old girl who is sent to work as a maid at Vermeers house and who becomes the subject of the painting known as Girl with a Pearl Earring. The basic linear narrative is not so much weak as overwhelmed by the eddying swirls of tension and emotion, often fickle in its course. The physical action is often obscured by seeming metaphor or perceived shifts of attitude and, the motivations for some of the action is unclear. However, the descriptive language of Girl with a Pearl Earring is evocative of time and place, anchoring the emotional story arc not only to the paintings of Vermeer, but to the locale of 17th c. Delft and in particular, Vermeers household.  There is an excellent web-site devoted to Vermeer and his work: http://www.essentialvermeer.com/vermeer_painting_part_one.html The book itself, describes only a few of Vermeers paintings, and it appears that I would have to go to Germany to see the famous painting, Girl with a Pearl Earring; but I will be able to see A Lady Writing when I travel home to Washington, DC this summer (the painting is at the National Gallery) and when I do, I know Ill see it with different eyes.

90045,"Okay, a book just drifted back into my mind tonight. It's a least 5 years old, probably older. From what I remember of the plot, a rich older woman is kidnapped and taken to a secluded location. I think I remember it being rural- at least a cabin in the woods, maybe even tents. The one scene I really remember is that the kidnappers gave the woman an apple at one point, and are surprised by the fact that she eats the entire apple (core, seeds, and all). She explains something about her father teaching them not to be wasteful as children. Now for the vague part of my memory. I think that the old woman's family won't pay the ransom (bad blood and all that trite jazz), so she ends up being held by the kidnappers much longer than they anticipated. Unfortunately, I don't remember the ending, which is why I'm here. Does this ring bells for any of you lovely people?",yes

90708,"So not knowing the name of this damn book has been plaguing me for years now, at least 5 since I've been trying to figure out what it was. I read it in the 90s but I'd imagine it's a fair bit older than that! (Maybe early 80s?) Here goes: Definitely fiction. The protagonist's father ( I think the protagonist is a teen girl) is part of a group working on a computer system that is totally running the city - there's a bubble created over the city to help control climate/environment. Anyways the computer ends up becoming self aware and controlling things as it wishes. The protagonist realizes what's going on and tries to stop the computer somehow. I think she gets some friends together and the computer tries to shock them. I think people are forced to stay inside, and when the protagonist tries to leave town she's prevented, by the bubble or some severe weather or combinations of things that the computer is causing. I think it gets resolved in the end but I'm not sure about that either. Anyways, if any of this seems familiar, let me know what you think it is!",yes

90760,"Pope Pius XII did not have cannons or aircraft, but he had something much more powerful: he had access to the ears and hearts of hundreds of millions of Catholics, and possibly many millions of Protestants. He also had a fully operational network of priests and diplomats everywhere in the world, including all the theatres of war. If he had said to the faithful clearly and repeatedly that denouncing, deporting, and murdering Jews were not only legal crimes but also mortal sins, and if he had done this relentlessly at every level of the Church, from his own messages to the priests tending the souls of soldiers in the field, and had done this at every opportunity, he may have succeeded in creating a moral revolt. If he had threatened the millions of Catholics then involved in the mass murder of the Jews with excommunication (something he was not afraid to do to all Communists in the world in one stroke after the war), he might have forced them to reconsider what they were doing. Perhaps this would not have stopped the Holocaust, but it would have certainly hindered it enormously. And, at the very least, it would have cemented the moral standing of the Church and would have protected the millions of Catholic souls in their care, souls that were forsaken by acting the way they did by not receiving the proper guidance from their Church. In Pope Pius XIIs realpolitk equation, Hitler was not only the lesser of the two evils between Nazism and Communism, but the strongest andin his viewthe only possible bulwark against the latter. For Pope Pius the greatest enemy was unquestionably atheistic Communism, and he led a faustian policy ultimately intended to protect the Church. Pope Pius felt a visceral hatred toward Communism, a hatred that began during his skirmishes with Communists while he was Apostolic Nuncio in Munich in the 1920s. But Pope Pius was also obsessed with protecting Rome from bombardment. He was keenly aware of the devastation the Germans and the Allies had left behind in many of the theatres of war, and he was determined to protect the Eternal City and all its Vatican treasures from that fate. So much so that the Sir Francis DArcy Osborne, the British Ambassador to the Vatican, wrote: I am revolted by Hitlers massacre of the Jewish race on the one hand and, on the other, the Vaticans apparently exclusive preoccupation . . . with the possibilities of the bombardment of Rome. Also, its disingenuous to claim that the Pope was afraid that by speaking out on behalf of the hounded Jews things would become worse for them. There was no way things could have been worse; the Germans were killing about 10,000 Jews in Auschwitz every dayand that was just one of the death camps. They were not killing more because they did not have the capacity. Nothing the Pope could have done or said would have made that hell worse. The example of what happened in Holland after the Church spoke up and the Germans deported the baptized Jews is misleading, because the Germans would have killed those Christians of Jewish extraction anyway. To the Germans a baptized Jew was still a Jew, so the fact that the Church spoke out did not precipitate their deportation: their ancestry did. Even if Pope Pius XII was a great person, and even ifas his supporters claimhe was a great friend and helper of Jews during the war, a Catholic whose heroic virtues merit the title of saint, pursuing the process of canonization is counterproductive at this time when so many people believe Pope Pius XII did not do everything in his power to save the Jews (to put it mildly). The Vatican Secret Archives for the WWII period need to be opened. This is ultimately also for the Church's benefit, even if it does show, as I think it will, that the Church as such did very little to help the hounded Jews. After all, it was the Church itself that published eleven volumes of documents forty years ago precisely to counter allegations that Pope Pius XII did not do as much as he should have. Its safe to assume the Church would have shown its best, most compelling documentation showing Pope Pius helping Jews if it had it, and it would have been totally counterproductive to have left clear evidence of this help out of those eleven volumes. I think one can logically assume the documentation simply does not exist. What do you think?",no

The relationships within the novel, engendered as much by intrigue as family ties, are as interwoven as the tapestries themselves and make for an amusing plot outline; but the overall story lacks a commitment to any of the characters on any more than a superficial level. The book contains full color plates of details (the women described in the novel) from the tapestries, but no pictures of the tapestries of any or of all in their entirety. http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ang/homes/home_id20393_u1l2.htm",no

91487,"Poison: A Novel of the Renaissance by Sara Poole Francesca is the fictitious poisoner to the very real, ruthless Borgia family, having killed to obtain the position so that she could avenge her father's death and assume his former position. The corrupt Pope Innocent VIII is ill and Cardinal Borgia intends on being his replacement. Poison might be a handy way to accomplish the goal, but it must be done without raising any suspicion against Borgia. In addition, the Jews have been run out of Spain and are being persecuted in Rome. The Pope is rumored to have an edict ready for his signature that will eliminate all Jews. Lucrezia, who was to become famous later in the Borgia story, was still a girl of only twelve. He does not fear you, the priest said. Not as he did your father. You are only a woman. God help me, I smiled. Innocent would have all of eternity to contemplate his error. This fast-moving historical fiction is well written. While it could have evolved into more historical romance than historical fiction, it did not, leaving the intrigue as the main part of the tale. The language gave the flavor of the period but did not become arcane. Told in the first person, Francesca occasionally addressed the readers directly, advising us that we already knew or did not need more information about this or that. She also alluded to happenings in years beyond the story. The copy I read was an Advance Readers' Copy, and had fewer mistakes than I expect in an ARC.

The girls is the main character; she is telepathic, and I think that she is the junior member of the ""research"" team.

She thinks to herself that the inhabitants of the world don't realize that she is actually reading the books, because people from her world can read as quickly as they can turn the pages; another in which she is separated from her father and the young man. She is scared, and she sends them a very LOUD telepathic message, which they don't respond to. Later they tell her that they heard her loud and clear, but they didn't respond because she had to learn how to solve whatever the problem was on her own.

92777,"Ok here's one I think needs a little work, any help would be appreciated. ************************************************* Private by James Patterson and Maxine Paetro is about Jack Morgan owner and operator of Private; a private investigation firm for the rich and powerful. Jack was a military chopper pilot whose father died in prison shortly after giving him the Private firm and a large chunk of change to make it happen the right way this time. We come into the picture when Jack finds out a friend of his was murdered. Next there has been a serial killer on the loose killing high school girls and has started increasing his pace. At the same time Jack's uncle, who owns a piece of a football team, thinks someone is fixing games for illegal betting but he doesn't know who, how or if it's just imaginary. It's rather amazing Jack ever has time to sleep. This was an average James Patterson book, though with more than average quirky characters. Jacks team seemed to be based off the TV crime dramas like NCIS or Criminal Minds. Like the TV shows, we jump in and only get the highlights for a bunch of these characters which we expect to be filled in more in later 'episodes'. We are given just enough for each so you want to know a little more. Jack has a top notch team, there's Justine, his ex-girlfriend, Del Rio, his ex-Marine, ex-Con buddy, Emilio Cruz the Ex-cop, Dr. Seymour 'Sci' Kloppenberg the forensic criminalist with an online video girlfriend 'Kit Kat' and last but not least Maureen Roth 'Mo-bot' , the middle aged, tattooed computer guru.

This isn't uncommon on eBay - many books, currently available direct from EP, are selling far in excess of their EP price. Now, I know out of print and rare items demand more, as do special editions, but I'm looking at apples to apples comparisons, and just wondering what the heck is going on. Any ideas? Are buyers on eBay really that gullible?",no

9321,"I thought I'd start a thread for this genre. I've not been reading loads of SF in the last few years, but I've enjoyed Adam Roberts. I think it's interesting that an English professor who specializes in Browning and Spencer, should write science fiction and parodies on the side. His first SF novel, Salt, is very good. I have read his earlier novels, my husband has been keeping up with the more recent ones. I also enjoy Ian R. MacLeod and was introduced to him through his first book The Great Wheel which is a low tech SF novel. His later novel ,The Light Ages, did a wonderful job of recreating an alternate Victorian era where magic (aether) is mined like coal. I will read anything this man writes. I never miss a Graham Joyce novel either. His novels involve magical realism to varying levels and his later novels, The Facts of Life and The Limits of Enchantment have been marketed as mainstream literature (which it is). The first novel I read of his was The Tooth Fairy, a fabulous coming of age story that includes unexpected and unwelcome visits from a tooth fairy like none you have imagined before. From there I went back to read his earlier novels and have kept current since. I'm sure there are others I will think of...",no

9413,"More than twenty years ago I was living in a provincial Japanese city and, as English books were few and far between I was delighted to find that there was a small library there with a haphazard scattering of tomes in English. Among them I came across a memoir of an English poet. As I recall it covered the years around World War II. I remember enjoying it tremendously, but can't, for the life of me, remember the author's name or the book's title. I do recall that the author did not fight in the war, and during those years was living on the coast in what I think must have been Cornwall. I remember that he wrote about scavenging on the beach after ships wrecked in a particularly treacherous stretch of ocean just off the coast from where the poet was living. I remember a bit about him managing to scavenge a barrel of gasoline which kept his car running--to the mayor's consternation--long after the local dignitaries had run out of fuel for their own machines. I vaguely--though this may be a false memory--also seem to remember a scene where the poet is in a cave and has a sort of vision which becomes, perhaps, a poem. That's pretty vague, but does anyone have any ideas? Thanks, D",yes

94389,"I heard it bandied about somewhere on this board that there are many other translations for this series besides the usual Sir Richard Burton translation. I was wondering if any of you had read the other translations, and if you can recommend a good one. I'm currently reading a ""best of"" Arabian Nights book which contains the Burton translations of the usual suspects...Al-addin and his wonderful lamp, Ali Babba and the forty thieves, Sinbad, etc. I am finding the Burton translation overly flourished, but still very readable and interesting. For some reason, the password to open the rock wall was ""Open, O Simsim"" instead of the usual ""Open Sesame"". Is simsim another word for sesame? Who knows. Anyway, I can see the need for a more simple translation...especially if I am going to get through all 1001+ stories. In other news, I was wondering which stories the 100 Greatest book contained, and why they among so many, were chosen. The book title does not mention anything about the fact that there's thousands of other stories besides what's contained within; I'm wondering if people even know there are more. I know this is sacrilege, but you simply must check out the Barnes and Noble edition of this book: http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Arabian-Nights/Richard-Francis-Burton/e/978... It is beautifully leatherbound, and contains dozens of brand-new, modern, two-page illustrations of nearly every story in the book. I own the entire 18 book set of Barnes and Noble classics, by the way, and some of them I actually prefer to the EP editions. I know, like I said, blasphemy. This happens to be one I would never part with for the EP version. Another is Grimm's Fairy Tales. Be warned, though, not all of the B&N leatherbounds are of the same quality. The Tales of Hans Christian Anderson, for example, is a cheaply made book with no illustrations, forwards, prefaces or novel typography of any kind.

94693,"Hello Everyone Quick introduction: Steve, originally from Glasgow and after living in Ireland for almost a decade now have settled in Australia with my family. Itchy feet. (or was it to escape the drizzle) Nice to see a Scottish librarythingers group :-) I have just finished The Memoirs of Sir James Melville of Halhill which was very interesting: personal reflections from a 16th century Scot on the machinations of politics in a time of great upheaval. Good read. My primary interest is in Stevenson. I just adore Kidnapped. I have several copies, the recent Folio Society illustrated edition being my favourite, though my pocket sized unabridged edition http://www.librarything.com/work/24257/book/61822106 which I bought many years ago just prior to boarding the overnight bus from London to Glasgow holds a fond place in my heart, having devoured it completely be the time I left the bus in Buchanan St Station.  I recently purchased Fo Bhruid but was really disappointed in this graphic version of Kidnapped in Gaelic. The illustrator turned Davie Balfour into some kind of Marvel Comics character in my opinion: the square jaw, fifteen years older looking than he should be, the stern look. Primarily I purchased the book for the Gaelic, but the illustrations got to me. Does anyone know of another Gaelic version of Kidnapped?

I think the vehicle flew, and went underwater. No adults were ever present. The format of the book was a hardcover comic - like TinTin - and some of the kids were French. One of the sub-themes was definitely cross-cultural understanding. I also seem to recall there being a talking animal - a parrot, I think - who accompanied the kids on their adventures.

95588,"Ah, I'm not too excited about this review. As it is now it feels pretty middle of the road to me. Any ideas on ways to punch it up? --- A gigantic alien race conquers the Earth and use it for storage!? Men Like Rats presents a world where the planet is covered with gargantuan warehouses (Lows) and cargo is moved back and forth via automated drop ships (Highs). Humans eke out an existence on the fringe, infesting the warehouses and ships like vermin. The setup reminded me of Rene Lalouxs strange animated movie Fantastic Planet with humans creeping among an outsized alien landscape that they do not comprehend. In Men Like Rats though, the aliens are offstage. We follow Richer the Quick, a human who has been living on his own for a while. The book doesn't really have a single story. It's more about following Richer through the world Chilson has created. Exploring that world was pretty interesting. It appears that things have been this way for a long while, as the humans have already adapted their theology to explain the Highs and Lows and the reason their Creators seeded their world with traps and vicious beasts (which are actually intended as pest control). But I think the description could have used some work. He chose to write the narrative using the language of his characters. This gave the book a bit of a learning curve (when I started the book, I had a hard time figuring out, what is a High? What is a Low? What is a Middleplace Low or a Lowerplace Hole?), which has been used to strong effect in other sci-fi novels, but I'm not sure it added to this book. Lots of the landscapes he writes about are so alien anyway. Some nice concrete description would have helped the reader idenitfy a little better. Still, I did get into the book. There was a neat concept here, but it was a little too confusingly presented and the storyline itself wasn't quite compelling enough to make it worth the effort. It wasn't fantastic, but it was a quick, interesting and quirky read with a unique (to me) world.",no

Prudence, who at 29 is teetering at the edge of spinsterhood, is an attractive, educated working girl. The two best friends share memories of their carefree days at Oxford, leisurely lunches, and gossip, but their ultimate goal is to find a suitable mate for Prudence."" /goodreads/ ""Another delightful glimpse of 1950s England, full of Pym's gentle but subversive little insights into the way the world (or at least this very middle-English bit of it) works. There ought to be a timeless quality about this story of vicars, spinsters and tea-parties on the lawn, but we are forever being reminded that this is a changing world. The village is on the fringe of the city; the local tradesmen are as involved in running the church as the more middle-class residents; everyone is affected by post-war shortages; there are no servants any more, but women from the village ""oblige"" with cooking and cleaning. Above all, it's a women's world. Men exist only on the fringes of the community. They are vain, impractical, in constant need of food and reassurance, and mostly have no very clear occupation (Dr Grampian is ""some kind of economist or historian""; Fabian does something or other in the City). They can be ornamental and nice to have around the place, but on the whole they are a bit of a nuisance. Women are focussed, competent and organised, and are the only people in the book we ever see doing anything useful. The exception to this rule is Jane, who is clever, a whizz when it comes to 17th century poetry, but hilariously absent-minded when it comes to her adopted role in life. She can imagine very clearly, in terms of Trollope, Jane Austen, and Miss Charlotte M. Yonge what a clergyman's wife should be, but she always somehow loses track of what she means to do about it herself. Fortunately, Mrs Glaze (who obliges at the vicarage) and Jane's teenage daughter are on hand to treat her as a sort of honorary male to be fed and tidied-up-after, and her husband is a new man avant la lettre who doesn't complain about the non-appearance of food at mealtimes. The text teams with little in-jokes: (...) Jane Austen's Emma is mentioned several times (Prudence's name was obviously picked to allow her to be annoyed by colleagues calling her ""Miss Bates"")(...) And there are some lovely lines - not least concerning the old battleaxe, Miss Doggett, who looks as though she ""had heard that men only want one thing, but had forgotten for the moment what it was."" Great fun, and as usual in Pym there is no neatly contrived ending to force closure on the characters: a few little rearrangements, everyone capable of doing so has learned a little bit about themselves, but not much has really changed."" /thorold, Librarything/ ""Pym writes loneliness, the urban/modern condition, and humanitys oft mistaken attempts at communication and companionship very well. Given that her characters are generally overlooked middle-aged people clinging quietly but desperately to a pretense of gentility, one might assume her stories are unhappy. Of course parts of them are, but I get the feeling that her characters are happier by the end of her novels than at the start. They definitely progress, toward intimacy with another person(s) or toward an inner understanding. This book is no exception. Jane is the dreamy, highly educated wife of a vicar; her friend Prudence is an equally highly educated younger woman searching for love. I loved Jane dearly. Shes forever quoting ancient poetry and not setting up for tea and wearing the wrong kind of dress, and she isnt unhappy about her lapses from femininity one bit. Shes just the sort of person who fuels her mind and heart and lets the rest of the world go to blazes through inattention."" /Wealhtheow Wylfing, goodreads/ ""Brilliant. Quotations: The lump in Prudences throat made it difficult for her to speak, but she managed to offer to change places so that the man and woman could be at the same table. They thanked her and the change was made. Prudence sat for the rest of the meal, listening to her neighbors conversation, her eyes full of tears. Disliking humanity in general, she was one of those excessively tender-hearted people who are greatly moved by the troubles of complete strangers, in which she sometimes imagined herself playing a noble part. The man sitting at her table, who had at first appeared to be a bore or even a menace, was now proved to be an object of interest. There was both nobility and pathos about him. Jane was sitting on the other side of the fire with her feet up on a pouffe; there was a book open on her lap and the Sunday papers were spread out at her side, but she was not reading; she had dropped off, as she frequently did on a Sunday afternoon, and her head was drooping over against the back of her chair; her mouth was slightly open too. She had just been reading the review of a novel where a character was said to emerge triumphantly in the round, and somehow this had set her nodding. ... After that all was blessed oblivion until the cruel shrilling of the front-door bell startled her into uttering a cry and sitting bolt upright in her chair. /Ann-Marie, goodreads/ ""I kept thinking that the novel could be summarized by: Recipe: 2 parts Jane Austin + 1 part P.G. Wodehouse, blend to a fine froth, chill and serve. Will I remember much about this novel two months from now? Probably not. Am I glad that I read it?

96392,"I'm reading The Vampire Lestat for probably the 4th or 5th time and this time around I'm seeing things different this time around then previously. For example: Before I joined LT and the Pagan and Wiccan groups it never really caught my attention before now about how much Paganism plays a role in The Vampire Lestat. I mean how Marius describes the story of how he became a vampire and talks about the Wicker Man and Woman sacrifices  ""And all these people who must die are guilty of some wrongdoing"" The sacrifices took place in The Sacred Grove in the forest ""And before sunrise, go into the Mother Earth you escape the lght. She will protect you""About serving ""the Holy Mother and rule only by the light of the moon and how the sun is their enemy"" How ""only the old ones who have long served the Great Mother survived and is still around"" ""To thrive on the blood of evildoers and even of the innoncent who were sacrificed to the Mother"" ""A great silver caldron of water stood before the altar, and as the priests sang, a chain of prisoners was led to this caldron, their arms bound behind their backs"" ""The voices were singing in concert around me as the priests placed the flowers in my hair, on my shoulders, at my feet"" About how ""The Druids surrounded me now and we proceeded to the sacred tree again, the hymns dying to a litany which commanded me to remain within the oak to sanctify the forest, to be its guardian, and to speak kindly thorugh the oak to those of the priesthood who would come from time to time to ask guidance of me"" In the past whenever I read the book I just thought of The Vampire Lestat as another book in The Vampire Chronicles and didn't recognize or even understand the Paganism part of the story. Now that I feel I have a much better understanding then I previously did of the Paganism aspect of the book I'm enjoying it a whole lot more, and would go as far to say the Paganism aspect of the book has made it a much better book too.

96926,"Here's my review for Shadows in the Mist, a book that got off to a rocky start, but did improve. --- Shadows in the Mist and I got off on the wrong foot. I went in expecting a schlocky World War II horror story about Nazis and their obsession with the occult. What I got at first was a schlocky DaVinci Code clone set in the present day with a main character so thin he didn't even have two dimensions. About fifty pages in, I was ready to give up on the book. Sean Chambers isn't so much a character as he is a chess piece for the author to move around to advance his plot. We are told that he is an Air Force pilot and that he has a wife and child. They never factor into the story in any way. Sean is able to immediately fly to Germany on his grandfather's suggestion without seeming to make any sort of arrangements. Fifty pages in though, it flashes back to World War II and gets a LOT better. Jack Chambers (Sean's grandfather) and his Lucky Seven have been through some of the worst fighting of the war. When a top secret O.S.S. X-2 commando squad approaches Chambers to assist on a mission behind enemy lines with a promise that the survivors will be sent home, Jack grudgingly accepts. They discover their target, the town of Reichskuhl is the sight of a massacre. The Nazis occupying the town have been butchered. What have the Lucky Seven gotten themselves into? Shadows in the Mist isn't the scariest horror story, but it is an interesting one, drawing on the Nazi interest with all things occult, references to Kabbalah, Norse mythology and the Freemasons. Shadows in the Mist is Brian Moreland's first book and it shows. He has a lot of growing to do as an author, but he is very skilled at handling action and his atmosphere wasn't too bad either. The pacing of the story never flags even as the tone morphs from eerie to over the top action through the course of the story. The characterizations are pretty weak, but since they are better than Sean from the beginning of the book, they felt like an improvement. I'm not sure that the opening, set in the modern day really added much. In fact, it made me doubt the wisdom of continuing the book. I wonder if it would have been better to cut it. Towards the end, as action came to dominate the book it all got to be a bit too much, but by then I was having enough fun that I was willing to roll my eyes and stick with it. A fun read. Not a classic. But if it were turned into a movie I'd see it.",no

Tales of the Unexpected by Roald Dahl  I read Dahl's short story ""The Landlady"" when I was about 10 and loved how dark it was. I loved this collection, although some of them are REALLY macabre. 2. Just Kids by Patti Smith I read this after seeing Patti Smith do a performace/reading at a concert hall. I literally could not put it down and read it in under 24 hours. 3. Catch-22 by Joseph Heller This is a book that I probably should have read years ago but just never got around to it. I found it a little hard to get in to, but once I was in, I couldn't put it down. 4. On the Road by Jack Kerouac This is another book that I should have already read. Unfortunately, hearing what a classic, amazing book this was before I read it kind of spoiled it for me. I didn't really enjoy it, and that makes me feel like a square. 5. The Discovery of France by Graham Robb I thought this was a really interesting read, especially as I didn't really know anything about French history prior to the 18th century. It was a bit choppy as it is arranged by subjects rather than in chronological order, but I think it would have been even more jumbled if it had been arranged otherwise. 6. Homeward Bound: A History of the Bahama Islands to 1850 by Sandra Riley One of the books I read bits of for my dissertation, I thought I should read it in its entirety. I didn't really like Riley's flowery writing style or the book's abrupt ending in 1850, but that part shouldn't have been a surprise.  7. La Dame aux Camelias by Alexandre Dumas This was a quick and easy read, which was great as I was ill and bedridden at the time.  8. The Elephant Vanishes by Haruki Murakami I didn't like this as much as I hoped I would. I felt like each story ended just as I was starting to enjoy them. 9. The Sutton Hoo Ship Burial by Angela Care Evans This was a nice description of the artefacts found during several excavations. 10. The Kon-Tiki Man: Thor Heyerdahl by Christopher Ralling I love Thor Heyerdahl and have read most of his books. I hoped this biography would have included more interviews and insights from Heyerdahl, but except for the first and last chapters, it's mainly a summary of his voyages. 11. The Pyramid by William Golding This book got some scathing reviews, but I didn't think it was too bad. The format was different, and I enjoyed the last chapter the best. I thought I had read more books than that! I went through a bit of a dry spell in January, and I guess I'm a slower reader than I thought.

For years, I have done most of my lists/reviews/comments/random thoughts over there. But they are shutting down at the end of the month. So, this seems like a good alternative to me.

This is the most accurate information available. I can only imagine what wailofatail did to get the guilded one's goat--challenged the integrity of the legacy, no doubt--but I can't believe the pettiness of the response. The guilded lists may have come from Easton Press, but only a fool would consider them to be the final word in accuracy. As all of us in this group know, the folks at Easton Press don't know their own history. Guilded's Famous Editions list seems to contain a long segment of wishful thinking and the Masterpieces list is missing many titles that were definitely included in that series. It's difficult to actually prove the FE list wrong, since evidence of non-publication is near impossible to come by. The Masterpieces of American Literature list is another story, however. I have a brochure from the 90s, along with a list of books in the series (sent directly from EP); both contain books not on the guilded legacy list (although that's not proof in and of itself). The clincher, however, is that I own a good number of books that were delivered to me when I subscribed to the Masterpieces series in the 80s that are not on his list.

98692,"Can I post a contentious question? (No, that's not it.) Should we be concerned about the viability of languages that are disappearing or are threatened by the dominance or triumphant imperialism of one of the major languages, whether Mandarin, English, Spanish or other? I ask partly because I live in a part of Wales where Welsh remains a living language, supported by communities and by its standing in local education, but where English-speaking incomers like me must be having some effect on its status. This is a complex issue, of course, but has far-reaching cultural ramifications in a wider global context.

Its a Young Adult novel with Jack Blank as the 12 year old main character. He has spent his whole life in St. Barnabys Home for the Hopeless, Abandoned, Forgotten, and Lost, an orphanage for those so described.  The book is similar to Harry Potter and Alcatraz Smedry (Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians) and in many ways really reminded my of Alcatraz. Both Alcatraz and Blank are raised as orphans, knowing/wishing they had a different life, then finding out they were sent from their secret country to live among the unenlightened. While Alcatraz is very tongue-in-cheek Blank is a bit more serious, though still a lot of fun. Jack Blank, who was left on the doorstep of St. Barnabys as a babe with a note pinned to his blanket calling him Jack. He grew up at St. Barnabys, wishing he were somewhere else. Jack had daydreams about getting super powers and becoming a superhero. One day while bailing out the basement as punishment for reading comic books, hes attacked by a large cyborg that resembled the Rustov robots in his comics, and he barely escapes. While trying to explain all the damage caused by the robot which blew up leaving no trace, Jazon Knight arrives and whisks Jack away, to bring him home. Jazon tells him about the Imagine Nation where all the impossible is possible and Jack is from there. This is the beginning of Jacks adventures and the old adage be careful what you wish for, you just might get it holds true.",no

Now i'm just getting lazy, and don't feel like sifting through post after post looking for the next thing that appeals to me. So, I'm gonna put forth a request for some good books.  First thing first; I'm picky. my fav. authors in SF are:  Peter Hamilton(love huge epics, try not too pick up a SF book unless 350+pages)  Jack McDivett (his books are shorter than PH but enjoyable to me)  Orson Card  The Herberts and the Dune books(Frank's books started out good and then went to crap, his son's books I like)  Larry Niven (Ringworld started out good and slowly died)  China Melville (Not a huge Steampunk fan but I like China)  Alastair Reynolds   Nick Sagan ( Loved his Idlewild series, and his dad is good too)  Tad Williams Otherland Series (Not too SF, but cyberpunkish?) Authors that don't agree with my taste are: Iain Banks Philip K. Dick Ursula K. Le Guin Robert A. Heinlein Neal Asher ( I am giving him a second try at the moment) I know I'm dismissing some major players in the SF realm as crap reading, as far as I'm concerned, but hey what can I say, I like what I like.

I recall in one story, a thief stole jewels from an ice covered place, but somehow or other he got trapped, and the final sentence was that "" sooner or later the ice would recover the jewels"" or something like that. In another (or the same), a wizard battled the ice by conjuring up an artificial sun, but the melting ice produced steam, which obscured the sun, and when the steam refroze, the wizard got frozen in it.
